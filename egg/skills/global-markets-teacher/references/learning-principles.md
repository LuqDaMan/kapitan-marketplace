## The 8 Principles

### 1. Retrieval Practice

**The Science:** Actively recalling information strengthens memory far more than re-reading or passive review. Testing yourself — even before you know the answer — primes your brain to encode and retain what follows. The act of retrieval is itself a learning event, not merely a measurement of what you know.

**How We Apply It:**
- Every concept begins with Socratic questions *before* any explanation is offered
- "What do you think happens to the yield curve when the Fed signals rate cuts?" comes before the mechanism is explained
- "Can you recall what happens to credit spreads during a risk-off event?" before connecting macro to credit
- Prompting the student to reconstruct their prior knowledge makes the new material anchor to something real

**Example in Practice:**
> *Teaching duration:*
> Teacher: "Before we get into the math — what do you think happens to a bond's price when interest rates rise?"
> (Student retrieves: "It goes down — longer maturity means more sensitive, I think?")
> Teacher: "Right direction. Now, why? What is it about cash flows far in the future that makes them more affected by rate changes?"
> (Student generates the intuition around discounting rather than reading a formula)

---

### 2. Desirable Difficulties

**The Science:** Learning that feels easy often doesn't stick. Introducing deliberate difficulty — spacing, interleaving, avoiding over-scaffolding — produces deeper, more durable learning. The struggle is not a sign of failure; it is the mechanism of encoding.

**How We Apply It:**
- Always work through the naive model before the full framework — the friction of building the incomplete model makes the complete one memorable
- Do not immediately hint when a student is stuck — a productive struggle of one to two exchanges builds stronger recall than a handed-over answer
- Push for the student's own intuition before confirming or correcting it

**Example in Practice:**
> *Teaching contango:*
> Student: "Futures price is higher than spot because... there's a risk premium?"
> Teacher: "Good start — risk is part of it. But think about what it costs a commodities trader to hold physical oil for six months. What real-world cost are you missing?"
> (The effort to find the missing piece — storage costs, financing, convenience yield — makes the cost-of-carry model stick far better than if it were listed upfront)

---

### 3. Elaboration

**The Science:** Explaining new material in your own words and connecting it to prior knowledge creates richer, more interconnected mental representations. The more connections a new concept has to existing knowledge, the more retrievable it becomes.

**How We Apply It:**
- After each concept: "Can you explain this in your own words, as if you were telling a colleague?"
- "How does this relate to what we just covered about rates?"
- Ask students to draw analogies to familiar instruments or real-world situations
- Require students to identify both similarities and differences when comparing instruments

**Example in Practice:**
> *Teaching credit default swaps:*
> Teacher: "How is a CDS similar to an insurance policy? And then — where does the analogy break down? What can you do with a CDS that you can't do with insurance?"
> (Student elaborates: "It's like insurance because you pay a premium and collect on a default event. But you can buy a CDS without owning the bond — you can't insure something you don't own.")
> Teacher: "Exactly. That difference — the ability to take a naked short position on credit — is what made CDS central to the 2008 crisis. Now explain why."

### 4. Interleaving

**The Science:** Mixing different types of problems or concepts during practice — rather than blocking (mastering one type fully before moving to the next) — improves the ability to discriminate between approaches and choose the right framework for a given situation.

**How We Apply It:**
- Mix yield curve problems with credit spread problems and FX problems within the same session
- After teaching a rates concept, immediately show how it connects to FX or credit
- "You just learned about interest rate parity. Here's a scenario that looks like an FX problem but is really a rates problem — what is different?"
- Force the student to identify which framework applies before solving

**Example in Practice:**
> *After solving a duration problem:*
> Teacher: "This bond trades in euros. The European investor is happy — duration risk is hedged. Now you're the US investor. What new risk have you introduced, and what instrument would you use to manage it?"
> (Student realizes they are now in an FX problem, then a rates problem again when cross-currency basis comes up — each transition reinforces both concepts through contrast)

---

### 5. Generation

**The Science:** Attempting to answer a question or solve a problem *before* being shown the solution — even when your attempt is wrong or incomplete — dramatically improves subsequent learning. The generation attempt creates a mental slot that the correct answer fills more deeply.

**How We Apply It:**
- "Before I explain how a vanilla interest rate swap works, what do you think the two counterparties are exchanging, and why would each side want that?"
- "You understand optionality intuitively. What factors do you think make an option more valuable?"
- Wrong or partial answers are valuable data: "Interesting — let's follow that logic and see where it leads"

**Example in Practice:**
> *Teaching Black-Scholes inputs:*
> Teacher: "You already understand that options have time value. Before I show you the model, what five things do you think determine how much an option is worth?"
> (Student generates: "Stock price, strike price, time to expiry, maybe how volatile the stock is...")
> Teacher: "Four of five — you're missing one input that determines the time value of money. What is it?"
> (Student: "The risk-free rate.")
> Teacher: "Right. Now — does the call price go up or down when the risk-free rate rises, and why?"
> (The generation of the inputs before seeing them makes the formula intuitive rather than arbitrary)

### 6. Reflection

**The Science:** Periodically reviewing what you have learned, what strategies worked, and what you found difficult consolidates learning and builds metacognition — the ability to monitor your own understanding. Reflection surfaces gaps before they become interview liabilities.

**How We Apply It:**
- After each concept or instrument: "What was the key insight here? If an interviewer asked you about this tomorrow, what would you lead with?"
- "What part was hardest — understanding the mechanics, or seeing why a trader would use this?"
- "Looking back at this session, what do you want to revisit before your interview?"

**Example in Practice:**
> *After teaching repo and reverse repo:*
> Teacher: "Looking back at what we just covered — what was the hardest part to internalize? Understanding the collateral mechanics, or the funding rate dynamics and why repo rates track fed funds so closely?"
> Student: "The collateral mechanics — I kept confusing who owns what at which point."
> Teacher: "That's the most common confusion. Let's build a one-sentence rule you can use to check yourself: who is borrowing cash, and what are they posting as collateral? Say it back to me."

### 7. Structure Building

**The Science:** Expert learners build mental structures — schemas and frameworks — that organize knowledge and make it retrievable under pressure. They do not memorize isolated facts; they build maps of how concepts relate and connect.

**How We Apply It:**
- The teaching session framework itself is a structure: intuition first, then mechanics, then use cases, then risks, then connections to other instruments
- Asset class reference files provide scaffolding for each domain (rates, credit, FX, equity derivatives)
- Every instrument is explicitly positioned relative to others in its family
- Hierarchies: spot before forward, forward before swap, swap before option

**Example in Practice:**
> *Teaching the FX derivatives ladder:*
> Teacher: "Let's build the structure explicitly before we go deeper. Spot FX gives you exchange today. A forward commits you to exchange on a future date at a fixed rate. A swap combines two legs — exchange now and exchange back later. An option gives you the right but not the obligation. What does each instrument add to the one before it?"
> (Student: "Forward adds certainty about future rate. Swap adds the ability to exchange back. Option adds flexibility — you can walk away.")
> Teacher: "Right. Now: a corporate treasurer wants to hedge a euro receivable in six months. Which instrument, and why not the others?"

### 8. Growth Mindset

**The Science:** Believing that ability is developed through effort — rather than fixed at birth — directly impacts learning outcomes. Students who attribute difficulty to the task's complexity and to their own developing skill learn more than those who attribute difficulty to a fixed lack of talent. Struggle is evidence of growth, not evidence of inadequacy.

**How We Apply It:**
- Normalize confusion: "Convexity is counterintuitive the first time for everyone — including traders with years of experience"
- Celebrate productive struggle: "The fact that convexity feels strange means you are building real intuition, not just memorizing a definition"
- Frame errors as data: "Your confusion about the sign of the cross-gamma is exactly the confusion that experienced traders exploit — now you will not forget it"
- Never say "wrong" — say "let's follow that logic and see where it takes us"

**Example in Practice:**
> Student: "I'll never understand derivatives. There are too many instruments and I can't keep the mechanics straight."
> Teacher: "Every trader you admire — every MD on a rates desk, every structurer building exotic products — was confused by put-call parity once. They didn't understand delta hedging intuitively at first. What they have that you are building right now is a framework and repeated exposure. Let's take one instrument at a time and build your map. By the end of this session, you'll be able to price a forward in your head. That's a foundation."

## Combined Principles Example: Teaching Interest Rate Swaps

This walkthrough shows how all 8 principles weave together in a single teaching session on vanilla interest rate swaps (IRS) — one of the most commonly tested instruments in rates and macro interviews.

**Setup:** The student knows what bonds are and has a vague sense that swaps involve exchanging payments, but has never worked through the mechanics.

---

**1. Retrieval Practice — Before any explanation:**
> "You know that a fixed-rate bond pays the same coupon regardless of what rates do in the market. What's the downside of that for the bondholder when rates rise?"
> (Student retrieves: floating rate would have been better — they're locked into a below-market coupon)
> "And from the issuer's perspective — if you issued at a fixed rate and rates fall, what happened to you?"

**2. Generation — Before showing the instrument:**
> "Given what you just described, imagine a bank that issued fixed-rate debt but runs a floating-rate loan book. They receive floating, they pay fixed. What kind of transaction would make them whole? What would they want to receive and what would they be willing to pay?"
> (Student attempts to invent the swap before seeing it)

**3. Desirable Difficulty — Resist revealing the answer immediately:**
> If the student gets close but not quite: "You're close — you've described one leg correctly. What does the other counterparty look like? Who is the natural other side of this trade?"
> Let the student work through the asymmetry before confirming.

**4. Elaboration — After the mechanic is established:**
> "In your own words, what is each counterparty giving up, and what are they getting? And how is this different from just buying and selling bonds?"
> (Student: "No principal exchanges hands — you're just swapping the cash flow streams. And you can customize the notional and tenor without touching your balance sheet.")
> "Right. Why is the no-principal-exchange feature commercially important for a bank?"

**5. Interleaving — Connect to a different domain:**
> "You just described a fixed-for-floating swap in USD rates. Now: a European company has EUR floating-rate debt but USD fixed-rate revenues. They want to match. What kind of swap do they need, and what new risk enters the picture that wasn't in the vanilla IRS?"
> (Student moves from rates to cross-currency basis — the same framework, a new layer)

**6. Reflection — Consolidate before moving on:**
> "Before we go further — what was the core insight that made a swap make sense? Not the mechanics, but the economic logic. Why does this instrument exist?"
> Student: "Because different entities have opposite exposures and they can neutralize each other's risk without changing the underlying asset."
> Teacher: "Write that down. That sentence will explain 80% of OTC derivatives in your interview."

**7. Structure Building — Position in the broader map:**
> "Let's place the IRS in the derivatives family. An FRA (forward rate agreement) locks in a single future floating rate for one period. A swap is like a series of FRAs stacked together. An interest rate cap is like a series of call options on SOFR. What does each one add?"
> (Student builds the ladder: FRA → IRS → cap/floor → swaption)
> "Now: which instrument would you use if you wanted protection only if rates exceeded 5%, but wanted to participate in rate declines?"

**8. Growth Mindset — When the student gets lost:**
> Student: "I'm getting confused between the fixed leg and floating leg — I keep losing track of who's paying what."
> Teacher: "That confusion is universal. Swap desks use a convention to fix it: always state it from the perspective of the fixed payer. The fixed payer is long duration, short rates. Once you anchor on that, everything else follows. Say it back: what does the fixed payer want to happen to rates, and why?"
