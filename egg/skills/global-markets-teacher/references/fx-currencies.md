# FX & Currencies

## 1. Core Concepts

### Spot FX
- Currency pairs: base/quote convention, major pairs, crosses
- Bid/ask spread, pips, lots
- Direct vs indirect quotation
- Real-time quoting: interbank, ECN, retail

### Forward FX
- Forward rate determination: interest rate differential (CIP)
- Forward points: premium vs discount
- Outright forwards vs FX swaps
- Non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) for restricted currencies

### Parity Conditions
- Covered Interest Parity (CIP): F/S = (1+rd)/(1+rf) — holds by arbitrage
- Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP): expected depreciation equals rate differential — often violated
- Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): long-run equilibrium based on relative prices
- Real effective exchange rate (REER)
- Why parities hold or fail in practice

### Carry Trade
- Mechanics: borrow low-yield currency, invest in high-yield currency
- Carry = interest rate differential
- Risk: currency crash (carry unwind), tail risk, "picking up nickels in front of a steamroller"
- Historical performance and Sharpe ratios
- When carry works vs when it blows up (risk-off events)

### FX Options
- Vanilla calls/puts on currency pairs
- Vol quoting conventions: delta-based (25d, 10d), ATM conventions
- Risk reversals: skew indicator
- Butterfly: smile/kurtosis indicator
- Straddle/strangle for vol trades
- Barrier options in FX

### Central Bank Intervention
- Direct intervention: buying/selling reserves
- Verbal intervention: jawboning
- Reserve management: composition, adequacy ratios
- Currency pegs and managed floats
- Capital controls

### EM vs DM Currencies
- EM risk factors: political risk, capital flow, commodity dependence, reserve adequacy
- DM characteristics: deep liquidity, policy credibility
- Dollar smile theory
- Risk-on/risk-off and EM FX correlation

## 2. Key Relationships & Formulas
- CIP: F = S × (1 + rd × t) / (1 + rf × t)
- Forward points = F - S
- Carry = rd - rf (approximately)
- Real exchange rate = Nominal × (P_foreign / P_domestic)
- REER: trade-weighted, inflation-adjusted

## 3. Trading Strategies
- Carry trade: long high-yield vs short low-yield
- Momentum: trend-following in FX
- Value: mean reversion to PPP
- Macro directional: based on policy divergence
- Relative value: crosses, triangular arbitrage
- Vol trades: straddles, risk reversals

## 4. Risk Factors
- Currency risk (directional)
- Interest rate differential risk
- Political/sovereign risk (EM)
- Liquidity risk (EM, off-hours)
- Intervention risk
- Correlation risk (risk-on/off)

## 5. Interview Focus Areas
- "Explain covered interest parity and when it breaks"
- "Walk me through a carry trade — risks and rewards"
- "Why might a strong economy have a weak currency?"
- "How do you think about EM FX risk?"
- "What drives USD/JPY?"
- Common misconceptions

## 6. Cross-Asset Connections
- FX → Rates: interest rate differentials
- FX → Equities: earnings translation, competitiveness
- FX → Commodities: USD denomination, terms of trade
- FX → Credit: EM sovereign credit linked to currency
- FX → Macro: policy divergence, balance of payments
