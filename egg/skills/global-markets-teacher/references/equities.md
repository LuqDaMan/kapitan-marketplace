# Equities

## 1. Core Concepts

### Valuation Frameworks
- DCF: free cash flow, discount rate (WACC), terminal value, sensitivity analysis
- Comparable analysis: P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, P/S — when to use which
- Dividend discount model (DDM)
- Sum-of-the-parts (SOTP)
- Equity risk premium: how to estimate, historical vs implied

### Market Microstructure
- Order types: market, limit, stop, iceberg, TWAP, VWAP
- Market makers, specialists, designated market makers
- Dark pools, lit exchanges, fragmentation
- Bid-ask spread determinants: volatility, information asymmetry, volume
- Price discovery process
- Auction mechanisms: opening, closing, halt

### Indices & ETFs
- Index construction: market-cap weighted, equal-weighted, price-weighted
- Major indices: S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 2000, MSCI, FTSE
- Index rebalancing effects
- ETF mechanics: creation/redemption, authorized participants, NAV vs price
- Tracking error

### Sectors & Rotation
- GICS sectors: cyclical vs defensive
- Sector rotation across business cycle
- Factor investing: value, growth, momentum, quality, size, low vol
- Style rotation

### Equity Derivatives
- Single stock options: calls, puts, covered calls, protective puts
- Index options: SPX vs SPY options
- Equity swaps: total return swaps
- Variance swaps, vol swaps
- Convertible bonds

### Corporate Actions
- Dividends: ex-date mechanics, special dividends
- Stock splits, reverse splits
- Buybacks: open market, accelerated, tender
- M&A: merger arb, hostile vs friendly, premium analysis
- Spin-offs, rights issues

### Short Selling
- Mechanics: borrow, sell, buy back, return
- Short interest, short squeeze dynamics
- Cost of borrow: general collateral vs hard-to-borrow
- Regulatory restrictions

## 2. Key Relationships & Formulas
- P/E = Price / EPS, forward vs trailing
- EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
- WACC = E/(E+D) × re + D/(E+D) × rd × (1-t)
- Gordon Growth: P = D1/(r-g)
- PEG ratio = P/E / growth rate
- Beta: systematic risk measure
- Sharpe ratio = (Rp - Rf) / σp

## 3. Trading Strategies
- Long/short equity: pair trades, sector neutral
- Statistical arbitrage: mean reversion, factor-based
- Event driven: M&A arb, earnings plays, spin-offs
- Index arbitrage: futures vs cash
- Dispersion trading: index vol vs single stock vol
- Momentum, mean reversion

## 4. Risk Factors
- Market risk (beta), Idiosyncratic risk (alpha)
- Sector concentration, Factor exposure
- Liquidity risk (small caps, EM)
- Event risk (earnings, regulatory)
- Short squeeze risk

## 5. Interview Focus Areas
- "Walk me through a DCF"
- "What's your favorite stock and why?" (trade pitch)
- "How do you think about valuation multiples?"
- "Explain market microstructure"
- "What sector would you be overweight/underweight and why?"

## 6. Cross-Asset Connections
- Equities ↔ Rates: discount rate, growth/value rotation
- Equities ↔ Credit: capital structure, distressed debt
- Equities ↔ FX: earnings translation, competitiveness
- Equities ↔ Commodities: input costs, energy sector
- Equities ↔ Macro: earnings cycle, consumer spending
