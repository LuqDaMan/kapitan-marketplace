# Bank Sales & Trading (S&T) Profile

## Representative Firms
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Barclays, Deutsche Bank

## Business Model
- Market making: providing liquidity to clients, earning bid-ask
- Flow trading: executing client orders, managing inventory risk
- Proprietary risk-taking (limited post-Volcker)
- Revenue: trading revenue + commissions + financing
- Desk structure: rates, credit, FX, equities, commodities (each with sub-desks)

## What They Test In Interviews
- Market awareness: "What's happening in markets?"
- Desk fit: which product/desk are you interested in and why?
- Client orientation: understanding how S&T serves institutional clients
- Technical knowledge: product mechanics, pricing, risk
- Teamwork and communication
- Brain teasers and probability (especially at Goldman)
- Why S&T specifically (vs IB, vs buy-side)

## Interview Emphasis by Section (M1-M5)
- M1 (Resume): 15% — why S&T, why this bank, which desk, what differentiates you
- M2 (Market Views): 25% — well-rounded macro awareness, connect to client relevance
- M3 (Trade Pitch): 20% — solid structure, client-relevant angles
- M4 (Scenario): 25% — cross-asset thinking, how it affects your desk
- M5 (Brain Teaser): 15% — standard probability, mental math, logic

## Culture & Values
- Team-oriented desk culture
- Client service mindset
- Diversity of backgrounds valued
- Rotational programs (analyst rotations across desks)
- Long-term career path: analyst → associate → VP → MD

## What Makes a Candidate Stand Out
- Genuine passion for markets (reads FT/BBG daily)
- Specific desk preference with good reasoning
- Understanding of market making vs directional trading
- Good "Why S&T?" answer — not just "I like markets"
- Technical depth appropriate to level

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing S&T with investment banking
- Not knowing which desk you want
- Having no market view
- Being too focused on prop trading (Volcker Rule)
- Not understanding client flow business
