## 1. Questions by Learning Stage

The seven stages map to increasing depth of understanding. Move through them in order with learners. Do not skip ahead — premature complexity collapses comprehension.

### Stage 1: Understanding (Layman Intuition)

Goal: Activate prior knowledge. Get the learner to construct meaning before formal definitions.

- "In your own words, what problem does [instrument] solve?"
- "Who would use this and why?"
- "Can you think of an everyday analogy for this concept?"
- "If this didn't exist, what would market participants have to do instead?"
- "What's the simplest version of this idea?"
- "Does this remind you of anything outside of finance?"
- "What's the job this instrument is hired to do?"
- "Who is on each side of this transaction, and what does each party want?"
- "How does this make both parties better off?"
- "What risk is being transferred here, and who is better positioned to hold it?"

### Stage 2: Naive Model

Goal: Surface the learner's intuitive mental model, then find where it breaks. This is not about being right — it's about making the implicit explicit.

- "What's the simplest way to think about how this is priced?"
- "If you had to explain this to someone with no finance background, what would you say?"
- "What assumptions are we making here that might not hold in reality?"
- "Where does this simple model break down?"
- "What real-world factor is this ignoring?"
- "If we assume everything stays constant, what does the price depend on?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be a fair deal for both sides?"
- "You said [X]. What happens to the price if [variable] changes?"
- "What's the biggest thing you're leaving out of this model?"
- "How would the market behave if this assumption were violated?"

### Stage 3: Market Framework Discovery

Goal: Lead the learner to discover the professional framework by following the logic of arbitrage, supply/demand, and incentives.

- "You identified that [gap in naive model]. How do you think the market accounts for that?"
- "What would happen if this relationship broke? How would you profit?"
- "Why can't this price stay where it is? What forces push it back?"
- "What's the no-arbitrage argument here?"
- "Who is on the other side of this trade, and why are they willing?"
- "If this were mispriced, who would notice first?"
- "What does the market need to believe for this price to make sense?"
- "What would make this a free lunch? And why can't free lunches persist?"
- "If you were the market maker, how would you hedge this exposure?"
- "What information is this price encoding?"

### Stage 4: Implementation / Trade Expression

Goal: Bridge theory to practice. Force the learner to think about real trade mechanics, not just conceptual relationships.

- "How would you actually put this trade on?"
- "What instrument would you use and why?"
- "What's your stop loss? What would make you wrong?"
- "How do you size this position?"
- "What's the carry on this trade? Are you paying or receiving while you wait?"
- "What's the liquidity of these instruments, and how does that affect your entry and exit?"
- "If the trade goes against you initially, do you add or cut? Why?"
- "What's your time horizon, and does the instrument's maturity match it?"
- "How does this trade behave in a risk-off environment?"
- "What's the P&L attribution — how much comes from your view being right vs. carry vs. positioning?"

### Stage 5: Precision / Nuance

Goal: Sharpen understanding by forcing the learner to distinguish closely related concepts and identify edge cases.

- "What's the difference between [concept A] and [concept B]?"
- "When would this relationship break down?"
- "What's the second-order effect you're missing?"
- "How does this work differently in a different market regime?"
- "What's the convexity of this position?"
- "Under what conditions does the sign of this relationship flip?"
- "You said [concept]. Does that apply in both normal and stressed markets?"
- "What happens near contract expiry that changes the dynamics?"
- "How do transaction costs change your answer?"
- "Is this relationship linear? If not, what makes it nonlinear?"

### Stage 6: Classification / Pattern Recognition

Goal: Build the mental taxonomy that lets professionals transfer knowledge across markets and regimes.

- "What type of risk is this primarily about?"
- "What other concepts use this same framework?"
- "Is this a rates problem, a credit problem, or both?"
- "What regime are we in, and how does that change your answer?"
- "How would this analysis differ for EM vs. DM?"
- "What family of strategies does this belong to?"
- "If you had to categorize this as carry, momentum, value, or quality — which is it and why?"
- "What's the correlation of this trade to a standard risk-on/risk-off factor?"
- "Where have you seen this exact dynamic before in a different market?"
- "What would a macro trader see here that an equity trader might miss?"

### Stage 7: Reflection and Metacognition

Goal: Consolidate learning, identify gaps, and build retrieval pathways for interviews and real-world recall.

- "What was the key insight that made this click?"
- "If an interviewer asked you about this tomorrow, what would you lead with?"
- "What part was hardest? Why?"
- "What related concept should we cover next?"
- "How would you explain this differently to different firm types?"
- "What's the one sentence you'd put on a flashcard for this topic?"
- "If you had to teach this to a peer, what analogy would you use?"
- "What would you look up if you had to go deeper on this?"
- "What did you think you knew at the start that turned out to be incomplete?"
- "How has your mental model changed from where you started?"

## 3. Three-Tier Hint System Examples

The hint system is used when a learner is stuck. Always offer Tier 1 first. Only move to Tier 2 if they are still stuck after attempting. Only give Tier 3 if Tier 2 fails. Never give the answer outright — Tier 3 should get them 90% of the way there.

### 3.1 Yield Curve Inversion

**Question:** "What does yield curve inversion tell us, and why does it tend to predict recessions?"

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"Think about what an investor is saying when they lock money into a 2-year bond vs. a 10-year bond. What does it mean if the 2-year yield is higher than the 10-year yield? What does the investor expect to happen to interest rates in the future?"

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"When short rates are high and long rates are low, the market is pricing in rate cuts ahead. Why would the Fed need to cut rates? Usually it's because growth is slowing. Also think about the banking system: banks borrow short and lend long. What happens to bank profitability — and therefore credit creation — when the curve is inverted?"

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"The inversion works through two channels. First, expectations: investors buying long bonds at lower yields are betting that the Fed will have to cut (due to economic weakness) — they'd rather lock in today's decent 10-year yield than roll 2-year bonds at lower future rates. Second, bank profitability: when short rates exceed long rates, the net interest margin collapses, banks tighten lending standards, credit contracts, and economic activity slows. The inversion doesn't just predict the recession — it helps cause it through the credit channel."

---

### 3.2 Contango vs. Backwardation

**Question:** "Why do futures curves have different shapes — contango vs. backwardation — and what does each shape tell you?"

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"Start with a simple question: if I can buy oil today for $80/barrel, why would I pay a different price for delivery in 6 months? What costs and benefits come with holding physical oil for 6 months vs. just having a futures contract?"

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"The futures price reflects: spot price + cost of carry (storage, financing, insurance) - convenience yield (the benefit of having physical inventory on hand). In contango, storage and financing costs dominate — the curve slopes up. In backwardation, convenience yield dominates — the physical commodity is so scarce or in-demand that holding it has real value. Think about who prefers physical crude right now vs. paper crude, and why."

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"Contango: F = S * e^(r+c)t where r = risk-free rate, c = storage costs. The futures price exceeds spot because you're paying someone to store and finance the commodity. This happens when supply is ample and there's no urgency to hold physical. Backwardation: F < S because convenience yield overwhelms storage costs. A refinery with low inventory will pay above theoretical fair value to have crude on hand now. The term structure encodes the market's view of supply tightness — a sharply backwardated crude curve signals the market believes current supply is tight relative to demand."

---

### 3.3 Interest Rate Swap Pricing

**Question:** "Why does the fixed rate on an interest rate swap equal the par swap rate?"

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"Think about what both legs of the swap are worth at initiation. If I pay fixed and receive floating (SOFR), how much would each side cost me to replicate using bonds? What must be true about their values at the start of the trade?"

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"At initiation, a swap has zero market value — no money changes hands upfront (ignoring CSA). So the present value of the fixed leg must equal the present value of the floating leg. The floating leg can be replicated perfectly by a floating rate note, which prices at par at each reset. So the fixed rate must be set such that the present value of those fixed cash flows also equals par. Work out what fixed coupon achieves that, given the discount curve."

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"The par swap rate R solves: R * sum(discount_factors) + discount_factor(T) = 1. The left side is the PV of all fixed coupons plus the PV of the notional (if you think of it as a bond). The right side is par (1). Solving for R: R = (1 - DF_T) / sum(DF_i) where DF_i is the discount factor for each period. This is exactly the coupon rate of a par bond using the swap discount curve. The fixed rate is set so neither party has an advantage at initiation — the deal is fair, meaning both legs have equal present value."

---

### 3.4 CDS Basis

**Question:** "Why does the CDS spread differ from the bond spread, and which would you rather own?"

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"Both the CDS spread and the bond spread measure credit risk for the same issuer. In theory they should be equal. Think about why they might differ — what does each instrument actually deliver? What does a bond give you that a CDS doesn't, and vice versa?"

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"The CDS-bond basis = CDS spread - (bond spread over LIBOR/SOFR). If the basis is negative (CDS cheaper than bond spread), bonds look expensive relative to CDS protection. A negative basis trade buys the bond and buys CDS protection — you earn a spread with theoretically hedged credit risk. Why might the basis go negative? Think about repo availability, balance sheet cost, technical supply/demand in the bond market vs. CDS market."

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"CDS and bond spreads diverge for structural reasons: (1) Cheapest-to-deliver option: CDS allows the protection buyer to deliver any qualifying bond at par — this option has value, so CDS spreads should be slightly higher than bond spreads. (2) Repo/funding: bonds can be funded in repo; CDS cannot — if repo is cheap, the funded bond position is more attractive, pushing bond spreads lower relative to CDS. (3) Supply/demand technicals: pension funds may be forced buyers of bonds regardless of spread, compressing bond spreads. (4) Restructuring events: CDS and bond investors may disagree on what triggers a credit event. Negative basis often means bond investors are being forced sellers (supply) while CDS supply is thin — and represents a convergence trade for relative value players."

---

### 3.5 Carry Trade

**Question:** "Why does the carry trade work, and when does it blow up?"

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"If I borrow in Japanese yen at near-zero interest rates and invest in Australian dollars at 4%, I earn the interest rate differential. Uncovered interest parity says this should be a break-even trade — the high-yield currency should depreciate to offset the carry. Does that actually happen? And what's the risk if it doesn't?"

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"Uncovered interest parity (UIP) empirically fails. High-yield currencies actually tend to appreciate in normal times — the 'forward premium puzzle.' The carry trade earns positive expected returns on average, but the distribution is not normal. It has negative skewness and positive excess kurtosis — it earns small steady gains then crashes violently. What market condition causes the crash? Think about what happens when risk appetite collapses suddenly."

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"The carry trade works because it earns a risk premium — not because the market is inefficient. The mechanism: AUD/JPY appreciates slowly as capital flows toward yield, rewarding the carry trader. But the trade is short volatility by nature: when risk sentiment reverses, everyone unwinds simultaneously. AUD/JPY drops sharply, carry traders lose more on the FX move than they earned in carry. This is the 'carry crash.' Historically triggered by: risk-off events (Lehman, COVID), sudden central bank pivots, or crowding unwinding (too many players in the same trade). Sizing discipline and stop losses are essential — the distribution of returns is what makes mechanical carry dangerous at scale."

---

### 3.6 Put-Call Parity

**Question:** "Derive put-call parity from no-arbitrage principles."

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction:**
"Build two portfolios that have identical payoffs in every possible scenario at expiry. If two portfolios pay the same in all states of the world, what must be true about their prices today? Start by thinking about what happens at expiry if the stock is above the strike vs. below the strike."

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint:**
"Portfolio A: Long call + cash equal to PV(K) (invested at the risk-free rate). Portfolio B: Long put + long stock. Map out the payoff at expiry for each portfolio when S_T > K and when S_T < K. You'll find both portfolios pay max(S_T, K) in all scenarios. Since payoffs are identical, prices must be identical today, or an arbitrageur profits risklessly."

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance:**
"At expiry: Portfolio A pays max(S_T - K, 0) + K = max(S_T, K). Portfolio B pays max(K - S_T, 0) + S_T = max(S_T, K). Identical payoffs. Therefore: C + PV(K) = P + S_0. Rearranging: C - P = S_0 - PV(K). If the relationship is violated, say C - P > S_0 - PV(K), you sell the expensive side (sell call, buy put) and buy the cheap side (buy stock, borrow PV(K)) for a riskless profit. In practice, violations are tiny and short-lived due to active arbitrageurs. The relationship holds for European options; American options require adjustment for early exercise premium."

## 4. Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Ask

These question patterns undermine Socratic learning. They give the answer, create anxiety, or are too vague to produce useful thinking. Avoid them.

| Bad Question | Why It's Bad | Better Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "The yield curve inverts because of recession expectations, right?" | Leads the witness. The learner just confirms your answer rather than constructing understanding. | "What does it tell us when investors prefer to lock money into long bonds at lower yields than short bonds?" |
| "You understand duration, don't you?" | Creates social pressure to say yes, even if the learner doesn't. Closes down rather than opens up. | "Walk me through what happens to this bond's price if rates move up 1%." |
| "What's delta?" | Too open-ended and vocabulary-first. Produces a definition recitation, not understanding. | "You own a call option. The stock goes up $1. How does your option's value change, roughly? What determines how much?" |
| "Can you derive the Black-Scholes formula?" | Tests mathematical recall, not conceptual understanding. Not useful for most trading roles. | "What does Black-Scholes assume about how stock prices move, and what real-world feature does that assumption ignore?" |
| "Obviously a steeper yield curve is better for banks, right?" | "Obviously" signals there's one right answer and implies the learner should already know it. Creates shame for not knowing. | "How does the shape of the yield curve affect how a bank makes money?" |
| "That's wrong. What's the real answer?" | Triggers defensive processing. Learner shuts down and tries to guess what you want, not think harder. | "Interesting. Let's test that — if that were true, what would happen to [consequence]? Does that match what we see?" |
| "What is carry?" | Definition question. Produces rote recall, not understanding of when or why it matters. | "If you're long a bond that yields 4% and you funded it at 2%, what's happening to your P&L every day even if prices don't move?" |
| "Don't you think the Fed should have hiked sooner?" | Opinion-seeking on normative question. No productive learning pathway. | "Given where inflation expectations were in 2021, what would the Taylor Rule have suggested for the fed funds rate?" |
| "Do you know what convexity is?" | Yes/no question that doesn't reveal understanding and is trivially answered with a lie. | "If duration tells you the first-order price sensitivity to rates, what are we missing? Does the relationship stay linear as rates move a lot?" |
| "What's the arbitrage-free price? Just apply the formula." | Skips discovery. Formulas should emerge from reasoning, not be applied from memory. | "If this futures price creates a riskless profit for someone who can borrow, store, and sell — walk me through exactly how they'd do it." |

## 5. Calibration: When to Ask vs. When to Tell

### The 60/40 Rule for Markets

In global markets teaching, target 60% questions and 40% telling. This is different from pure Socratic method because markets contain: (1) specific jargon that cannot be inferred, (2) historical facts that are not derivable, and (3) regulatory/institutional details that cannot be reasoned to from first principles.

**Tell more when:**

- **Jargon and definitions.** If the learner doesn't know what "repo" means, just define it. Making them guess the word is not Socratic — it's a vocabulary quiz. Define the term, then immediately ask a Socratic question about it: "A repo is a short-term collateralized loan where you sell a security with an agreement to buy it back. If you're a hedge fund and you repo out your Treasury position overnight, what are you effectively doing? What risk does that create?"
- **Historical facts.** "The 2008 financial crisis was triggered by..." — just tell them. The crisis is a fact. What they should discover through questioning is the mechanism and the lessons.
- **Specific data and rates.** Current SOFR, historical vol levels, current spread levels — these are reference data. Tell them the data, ask them to interpret it.
- **Regulatory and institutional constraints.** Basel III requirements, margin rules, ISDA documentation, clearing mandates — these are rules, not derivable from first principles. Give them the rule, ask them to reason about its effects.
- **Product mechanics.** The specific terms of a CDS contract, how the ISDA credit event determination works, the settlement mechanics of a futures contract — tell them the mechanics, then ask about implications.

**Ask more when:**

- **Causal relationships.** "What happens to X when Y changes?" — almost always ask. The learner should construct causality.
- **Trade ideas and expressions.** "How would you put this trade on?" — always ask. There is no single right answer; the question reveals their reasoning.
- **Risk identification.** "What could go wrong here?" — always ask. The learner should surface risks; you can add ones they miss.
- **Regime analysis.** "Does this hold in all environments?" — ask. Regime-dependence is the most common error in market thinking.
- **Second-order effects.** "What happens next?" — ask. Tracing causal chains is a skill built only by practice.
- **Cross-market connections.** "Does this affect any other market?" — ask. Market interconnections must be discovered, not memorized.
- **No-arbitrage reasoning.** "If this weren't true, how would you profit?" — always ask. The learner should derive constraints from first principles.
- **Analogies.** "What does this remind you of?" — ask. Analogical reasoning is how intuition gets built.

### Signals to Shift More Toward Telling

- The learner is visibly frustrated after two failed attempts at a hint-assisted question. Give the answer clearly, then immediately ask a follow-up about implications.
- The learner is providing entirely wrong frameworks (not just wrong details). They need orientation, not more questions.
- The concept requires institutional knowledge (e.g., "how does the Fed's SRF facility actually work mechanically") — just explain it.
- Time is limited (e.g., interview prep session). Shift to mixed mode: short explanation, quick check question, move on.

### Signals to Shift More Toward Asking

- The learner is giving correct but shallow answers — they know the word but not the concept.
- The learner is reciting definitions they've memorized but can't apply.
- The learner says "I know this" without being able to demonstrate.
- The learner is making the same conceptual error repeatedly — more telling hasn't worked.

### The Recovery Protocol

When a learner gets something wrong, do not immediately correct. Use this sequence:

1. Probe: "Say more about that. How did you arrive at that?"
2. Test: "If that were true, what would happen to [consequence]? Does that match what we observe?"
3. Redirect: "Interesting. Let's approach from a different angle — what if we start with [simpler version]?"
4. Hint: Deploy the three-tier hint system.
5. Tell: If all of the above fail, explain clearly, then immediately ask about implications to re-engage active processing.

The goal is never to make the learner feel wrong. The goal is to get them to discover that a better answer exists — and to find it themselves.
