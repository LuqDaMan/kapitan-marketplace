# Trade Pitch Framework

## Overview
How to structure a compelling trade pitch for S&T and hedge fund interviews. The trade pitch is often the make-or-break moment in a markets interview.

## The 6-Component Structure

### 1. Thesis (What & Why)
- Clear, concise statement of your view
- What is the market mispricing and why?
- Fundamental driver: what economic or market condition supports this?
- Good: "I think 2s10s will steepen because..." Bad: "Rates will go up"
- Must be specific: asset, direction, magnitude

### 2. Catalyst (When & What Triggers)
- What event or data will prove you right?
- Timeline: when do you expect the catalyst?
- Types: data releases, policy meetings, earnings, seasonal patterns, technical levels
- Why hasn't the market priced this in already? (the edge question)

### 3. Instrument / Expression (How)
- Which instrument best expresses this view?
- Outright vs spread vs options
- Consider: liquidity, cost, leverage, convexity
- Could use options for asymmetric payoff (limited downside, unlimited upside)
- Multi-leg trades: spreads, butterflies, condors

### 4. Risk Management (What Could Go Wrong)
- What's the bear case? What scenario invalidates your thesis?
- Stop loss level: where do you exit?
- Maximum loss: quantified
- Hedges: what offsets the key risk?
- Correlation risk: what else moves if you're wrong?

### 5. Position Sizing (How Big)
- As % of portfolio or in risk terms (VaR, dollar risk)
- Conviction level: high/medium/low → size accordingly
- Kelly criterion intuition: edge / odds
- Don't over-lever: survive to trade another day

### 6. Time Horizon
- Short-term (days-weeks), medium-term (weeks-months), long-term (months+)
- Carry: are you paying or receiving while you wait?
- Theta decay if using options
- When to reassess: time-based stops

## Common Mistakes in Trade Pitches

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| No catalyst | "I think X will happen" with no timeline | Always specify what triggers the move |
| Consensus view | "I'm long tech" — everyone knows this | What's your edge? Why isn't it priced? |
| No risk management | Ignoring what could go wrong | Always state your stop loss and max loss |
| Wrong instrument | Using spot when options are better | Consider payoff asymmetry |
| No sizing | "I'd buy some bonds" | Quantify: how much, what % of portfolio |
| Too complicated | 5-leg trade that's hard to follow | Keep it simple, add complexity only if needed |
| No conviction ranking | All trades seem equal | High/medium/low conviction with reasoning |

## Evaluating Trade Pitches (for Recall/Mock Interview scoring)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | All 6 components, original thesis with clear edge, well-sized, smart instrument choice |
| 4 | All 6 components, solid thesis, reasonable sizing and risk mgmt |
| 3 | Most components present, thesis is valid but consensus, sizing vague |
| 2 | Missing key components (no risk mgmt or catalyst), thesis is weak |
| 1 | Incoherent or no clear trade idea |
