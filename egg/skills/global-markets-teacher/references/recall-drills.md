## 1. Scenario Edge Case Bank

Each scenario poses a market situation and asks "what happens next?" Focus on non-obvious implications. Good recall answers identify the primary mechanism, the secondary effects, and at least one counterintuitive element.

---

### Rates

- "The Fed hikes 25bps but forward guidance turns dovish. What happens to the 2y vs 10y spread?"
  - *Key concept: policy expectations drive the front end more than hikes themselves; dovish guidance flattens or inverts further*

- "CPI comes in at 2.1% vs 2.0% expected. Why might bonds rally instead of sell off?"
  - *Key concept: if the miss is driven by a component the market was already pricing out (e.g., shelter), or if growth fears dominate, the rate-cut path can still steepen*

- "The Treasury announces a surprise increase in long-dated issuance. Walk me through the impact."
  - *Key concept: supply pressure widens term premium, 10y+ yields rise, curve steepens, pressure on risk assets via discount rate*

- "A major bank fails and repo rates spike. What's the transmission mechanism to other asset classes?"
  - *Key concept: repo is the plumbing; spike means collateral hoarding, forced deleveraging, credit spread widening, equity sell-off, flight to Treasuries*

- "The Fed begins balance sheet expansion (QE) but doesn't cut rates. What's the effect on the curve?"
  - *Key concept: QE suppresses term premium at the long end, curve flattens even without front-end cuts; different from rate cuts*

- "Breakeven inflation rises sharply while TIPS yields stay flat. What's happening in nominal space?"
  - *Key concept: nominal yields must be rising; implies inflation expectations are driving the move, not real rates*

- "The Fed pauses hikes but signals 'higher for longer.' What happens to 2y yields vs 10y?"
  - *Key concept: 2y anchors to policy rate expectation (stays elevated), 10y may rally if growth slows, re-flattening or further inversion*

- "A 10y Treasury auction tails by 3bps. What happens in the immediate aftermath?"
  - *Key concept: weak auction signals insufficient demand; dealers are stuck long, they sell, yields spike short-term; watch for concession on next auction*

- "Overnight indexed swap (OIS) spreads widen sharply. What is the market signaling?"
  - *Key concept: OIS spread = bank credit risk vs risk-free; widening signals funding stress or counterparty fear, similar to Libor-OIS pre-GFC*

- "Real yields turn sharply negative. What's the theoretical impact on gold and risk assets?"
  - *Key concept: negative real yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold; bullish for gold and compresses equity discount rates*

---

### FX

- "The ECB cuts rates but EUR rallies. How is this possible?"
  - *Key concept: the cut was priced in or the rate differential is still favorable; or the cut signals growth confidence, not distress; or USD is weakening simultaneously*

- "USD/JPY drops 5% overnight. What positions are being unwound?"
  - *Key concept: JPY carry trades (borrow JPY at low rates, invest in higher-yield assets); unwind = buy JPY, sell risk assets globally*

- "An EM central bank burns $20B in reserves defending its peg. What happens next?"
  - *Key concept: reserve depletion is visible and self-defeating; market senses capitulation; speculative pressure intensifies; likely outcome is peg break or sharp devaluation*

- "The dollar index (DXY) rallies 3% in one week. What are the second-order effects on commodities?"
  - *Key concept: commodities priced in USD become more expensive in local currency terms globally, suppressing demand; commodity prices typically fall*

- "EUR/USD implied volatility rises sharply before an ECB meeting. What does this tell you about positioning?"
  - *Key concept: vol premium = uncertainty about the outcome; suggests markets are hedging large directional bets or are poorly positioned*

- "A country's current account deficit narrows sharply due to a commodity price collapse. What happens to its currency?"
  - *Key concept: narrowing CA deficit reduces FX supply pressure, but commodity collapse also signals growth slowdown; net effect depends on which force dominates*

- "The SNB unexpectedly removes the EUR/CHF floor. Walk through the market impact."
  - *Key concept: CHF spikes violently; positions short CHF are stopped out; leveraged FX players face margin calls; equity markets in CHF terms crash; risk-off globally*

- "USD/CNH and USD/CNY diverge significantly. What does this mean?"
  - *Key concept: CNH is offshore (freely traded), CNY is onshore (managed); divergence signals capital outflow pressure or PBOC intervention differentials*

- "A G10 currency falls 10% in a month with no change in rate differentials. What are the possible explanations?"
  - *Key concept: political risk premium, terms-of-trade shock, sovereign downgrade, capital flight, or shift in global risk appetite against that country*

- "Turkey's central bank hikes rates 500bps but the lira continues to fall. Why?"
  - *Key concept: if credibility is gone, rate hikes are insufficient; markets price default risk, political interference, or continued reserve depletion*

---

### Equities

- "VIX spikes to 40 but S&P only drops 2%. What's happening?"
  - *Key concept: demand for tail hedges is high (fear of more downside), but actual realized moves are small; vol markets pricing an event the spot market hasn't priced yet*

- "A stock beats earnings by 20% but drops 10%. Explain."
  - *Key concept: guidance for the next quarter disappointed; or the beat was in a non-core segment; or the stock was priced for perfection (high multiple), so any concern triggers selling*

- "Two companies merge. The acquirer's stock drops 8% on announcement. What's the market saying?"
  - *Key concept: market disagrees with the price paid (overpayment), or synergies are doubted, or the acquisition dilutes acquirer's earnings or focus*

- "A tech sector ETF drops 5% but the underlying stocks are flat. How is this possible?"
  - *Key concept: usually not possible at settlement, but intraday liquidity differences can cause ETF to lead; alternatively, creation/redemption mechanism is stressed*

- "S&P earnings growth is positive but the index falls. What's the explanation?"
  - *Key concept: P/E multiple compression; rising rates discount future earnings more heavily; market pays less per dollar of earnings even as earnings grow*

- "A defensive sector (utilities) sells off at the same time as tech. What does this tell you?"
  - *Key concept: not a risk-off rotation; likely a rate-driven selloff where duration across all sectors is punished simultaneously*

- "Short interest in a stock rises to 40% of float. What are the risks and opportunities?"
  - *Key concept: high short interest = vulnerability to short squeeze if positive catalyst arrives; but also signals sophisticated investors see structural problems*

- "Buyback blackout period begins for most S&P 500 companies. What's the market implication?"
  - *Key concept: buybacks are a major source of equity demand; blackout removes a price-insensitive buyer; markets often underperform during blackout windows*

- "A stock's put-call skew steepens sharply. What are market participants pricing?"
  - *Key concept: puts becoming more expensive relative to calls signals demand for downside protection; market expects higher probability of sharp drops than rallies*

- "Earnings per share rises but revenues fall. Is this sustainable?"
  - *Key concept: margin expansion or buybacks driving EPS, not top-line growth; typically unsustainable if costs are cut to exhaustion or buybacks are debt-funded*

---

### Commodities

- "Oil inventories draw 10M barrels but WTI falls. Why?"
  - *Key concept: the draw was already priced in; or demand destruction fears (recession) are dominating supply signals; or a different grade/region's inventory is building*

- "Contango steepens sharply in natural gas. What's the market telling you?"
  - *Key concept: spot supply glut relative to future expected tightness; storage is filling; holders of physical gas are paying to defer delivery*

- "Gold and the dollar rally simultaneously. How is this possible?"
  - *Key concept: both can rally in a risk-off flight to safety event; or the gold move is driven by central bank buying (price-insensitive) that overwhelms the usual inverse correlation*

- "Copper prices fall 15% in a month. What sectors are repricing simultaneously?"
  - *Key concept: copper is a global growth proxy; fall signals growth slowdown fears; EM equities, industrial stocks, AUD (commodity currency) all reprice lower*

- "The oil futures curve shifts from backwardation to contango. What changed?"
  - *Key concept: spot tightness relieved (supply returning or demand falling); storage economics shift; roll yield for long commodity positions turns negative*

- "A major crop report comes in bearish but wheat futures rally. What's the explanation?"
  - *Key concept: geopolitical supply disruption overrides the bearish data; or the rally is driven by a different wheat class or export restriction announcement*

- "LME nickel trading is halted after a 250% spike in one day. Walk through the systemic implications."
  - *Key concept: forced short covering from a major producer; exchange credibility at risk; counterparty risk spikes; other industrial metals price in potential for similar squeezes*

- "Silver diverges significantly from gold (gold/silver ratio spikes). What's happening?"
  - *Key concept: silver has industrial demand component; if ratio spikes, industrial demand is falling (recession fears) while gold is rising on safe-haven demand*

- "Brent-WTI spread widens to $15. What's causing it and who profits?"
  - *Key concept: logistics bottlenecks (Cushing storage or pipeline constraints), or geopolitical disruptions to North Sea supply; refiners with access to WTI benefit*

- "Corn and soybean prices move in opposite directions during planting season. What's the signal?"
  - *Key concept: farmers are shifting acreage; relative price signals where capital (planting decisions) will flow; soybean planting rises if soybeans are more profitable*

---

### Credit

- "IG spreads tighten while HY spreads widen. What's the market signaling?"
  - *Key concept: flight to quality within credit; risk appetite is deteriorating for lower-quality issuers; often precedes broader credit stress*

- "A company's CDS trades significantly tighter than its bond spread implies. How do you exploit this?"
  - *Key concept: basis trade — buy the bond (wider spread = cheaper protection already embedded), buy CDS (tighter = cheap protection); looking for convergence; manage funding risk*

- "A leveraged buyout is announced. What happens to the target's existing investment-grade bonds?"
  - *Key concept: LBO typically increases leverage; IG bonds reprice to HY spreads (event risk); investors demand change-of-control put provisions*

- "Corporate bond issuance surges in January. What's the carry implication for spread markets?"
  - *Key concept: new issue concessions temporarily cheapen the market; primary supply pressure widens spreads; after absorption, technicals stabilize or tighten*

- "A fallen angel (IG to HY downgrade) is announced. Walk through the mechanical selling pressure."
  - *Key concept: IG-mandated investors must sell; HY buyers step in at a lower price; this 'mechanical' selling creates a predictable price dip and recovery pattern*

- "CDX IG and CDX HY diverge sharply. What's the interpretation?"
  - *Key concept: CDX IG is 5y protection on 125 IG names; CDX HY is 5y on 100 HY names; divergence signals stress is concentrated in lower-quality credit, not systemic*

- "A company misses its interest coverage ratio covenant. What happens next?"
  - *Key concept: technical default triggers negotiation with lenders; potential waiver, amendment, or restructuring; CDS triggers if payment is missed; equity wiped in reorganization*

- "Leveraged loan prices drop while CLO equity tranches hold. How is this possible short-term?"
  - *Key concept: CLO equity is marked to model more slowly; senior CLO tranches buffer equity from immediate losses; eventually equity reprices as defaults accumulate*

- "Sovereign CDS of a developed market economy widens sharply despite no credit event. What's the cause?"
  - *Key concept: political risk (debt ceiling, fiscal profligacy), global risk-off driving CDS demand as hedges, or technical supply/demand in CDS market itself*

- "The BB-BBB spread differential collapses to near zero. What does this mean for HY investors?"
  - *Key concept: HY investors are not being compensated for the extra risk of fallen-angel or upgrade optionality; risk-reward in BB is poor; may signal late credit cycle*

---

### Crypto

- "BTC rallies 15% while ETH is flat. What's driving the divergence?"
  - *Key concept: institutional or ETF-driven flows into BTC specifically; ETH may face its own headwinds (network issues, staking dynamics, competing L1s); macro vs. tech narrative divergence*

- "A major stablecoin depegs to $0.97. Walk me through the cascade."
  - *Key concept: loss of confidence triggers redemptions; redemption mechanism under stress (algorithmic or collateral-based); contagion to exchanges holding the stablecoin; DeFi liquidations if used as collateral*

- "BTC perpetual futures funding rate turns deeply negative. What does this signal?"
  - *Key concept: shorts are paying longs to hold; market is net short; extreme negative funding often precedes short squeezes if spot buying returns*

- "Crypto markets sell off sharply the same day as NASDAQ. What's happening to the diversification narrative?"
  - *Key concept: in risk-off events, crypto correlates with risk assets; the 'digital gold' narrative breaks down; correlation rises in drawdowns (same as most alternative assets)*

- "On-chain data shows large BTC wallets ('whales') accumulating during a price dip. How do you interpret this?"
  - *Key concept: long-term holders increasing exposure is a bullish signal historically; but also possible they are wrong, or this is a known distribution strategy*

- "ETH gas fees spike to 200 gwei. What does this mean for DeFi protocols?"
  - *Key concept: high gas fees price out small users; only large transactions are economical; DeFi activity concentrates in whales; L2 adoption accelerates as cheaper alternative*

- "A crypto exchange reports record net inflows of BTC. Is this bullish or bearish?"
  - *Key concept: exchange inflows typically precede selling (holders moving to exchanges to sell); bearish signal if sustained; opposite of cold wallet accumulation*

- "Crypto market cap falls 50% but BTC dominance rises to 60%. What does this tell you about altcoins?"
  - *Key concept: altcoins are being crushed harder than BTC; investors de-risk into BTC as the 'least bad' crypto; classic pattern in crypto bear markets*

- "A country announces it is adopting BTC as legal tender. BTC rallies initially, then reverses. Why?"
  - *Key concept: adoption news is bullish headline but small country = small actual demand impact; profit-taking on the news; potential for regulatory backlash in other jurisdictions*

- "USDT (Tether) market cap grows by $10B in one week. What does this signal about crypto market positioning?"
  - *Key concept: new capital entering the ecosystem and parking in stablecoins before deployment; often precedes BTC spot buying; bullish forward-looking signal*

---

### Macro

- "The yield curve uninverts. Is this bullish or bearish?"
  - *Key concept: depends on the mechanism; bull steepener (long end rallies as growth slows) is bearish; bear steepener (short end falls as Fed cuts into recession) is also bearish near-term; steepening itself is NOT a buy signal — recessions often start around uninversion*

- "PMI is at 49 but markets are rallying. Explain."
  - *Key concept: 49 is contractionary but markets look forward; if 49 is better than feared (expected 46), it's a positive surprise; or markets are pricing in policy response (rate cuts)*

- "GDP growth is strong but the stock market underperforms for a year. How do you reconcile this?"
  - *Key concept: stock market is a discounting mechanism; if growth is 'too hot' and drives rate hikes, the present value of future cash flows falls; also, GDP and corporate earnings diverge*

- "Unemployment falls to 3.2% but wages are not rising. What's the macro explanation?"
  - *Key concept: labor market slack from hidden unemployed (discouraged workers re-entering); or productivity gains absorbing demand; or unionization is weak, limiting worker bargaining power*

- "The current account deficit widens while the budget deficit narrows. Is the currency strengthening or weakening?"
  - *Key concept: twin deficits theory suggests both weaken currency; but narrowing budget deficit can signal fiscal credibility; current account widening suggests more FX outflows; net effect depends on capital flows*

- "Inflation expectations become 'unanchored.' What does this mean and what is the Fed's response?"
  - *Key concept: if 5y5y forward inflation expectations rise above 2.5-3%, the Fed loses credibility; they must aggressively hike to re-anchor, even at the cost of recession*

- "A country runs persistent current account surpluses. What does this imply about its savings-investment balance?"
  - *Key concept: CA surplus = excess national savings over investment; country is a net lender to the world; capital is flowing out in search of higher returns abroad*

- "Global trade volumes collapse by 15% over 6 months. Walk through the asset class impacts."
  - *Key concept: shipping rates crash; EM export-dependent economies deteriorate; USD strengthens (safe haven); commodity demand falls; global growth expectations revise lower*

- "The U.S. dollar reserve currency share falls from 60% to 50% over a decade. What are the implications?"
  - *Key concept: U.S. borrowing costs rise as foreign demand for Treasuries falls; USD weakens structurally; dollar-denominated commodity pricing challenged; petrodollar system under pressure*

- "A central bank cuts rates but credit conditions tighten simultaneously. What's happening?"
  - *Key concept: bank lending standards are tightening (credit crunch); rate cuts are ineffective if banks aren't transmitting — pushing on a string scenario; fiscal policy may be needed*

## 2. Concept Precision Probe Bank

These questions test precise understanding. The user must give exact definitions, not vague ones. Correct answers require distinguishing between terms that are commonly conflated.

---

### Duration and Convexity

- "What's the difference between modified duration and Macaulay duration? When do you use each?"
  - *Macaulay: weighted average time to cash flows (in years). Modified: Macaulay / (1 + y/n), measures price sensitivity to yield. Use Macaulay for matching liabilities by time; use modified for hedging.*

- "A bond has positive convexity. What does that mean for P&L in a large rate move, either direction?"
  - *Positive convexity means the price-yield relationship is curved upward: price rises more than duration predicts when yields fall, and falls less than duration predicts when yields rise. You win on both sides of large moves.*

- "A mortgage-backed security has negative convexity. Explain when and why."
  - *Prepayment risk: when rates fall, homeowners refinance, shortening duration; when rates rise, prepayments slow, extending duration. You get the worst outcome in both scenarios.*

- "If two bonds have the same duration but different convexity, which is worth more and why?"
  - *Higher convexity is always worth more (ceteris paribus) because it provides better price performance in large rate moves. The market will price this in via lower yield.*

- "Define DV01 and explain how it differs from duration."
  - *DV01 (dollar value of a basis point): dollar change in bond price for 1bp move. Duration is a percentage measure. DV01 = Duration × Price × 0.0001. DV01 is more useful for position sizing.*

- "A bond portfolio has duration of 7. The manager wants to reduce duration to 5 using Treasury futures. Walk through the calculation."
  - *Calculate the DV01 of the portfolio and the DV01 of the futures contract. Contracts needed = (Target duration - Current duration) × Portfolio value / (Futures DV01 × 100). Sell futures to shorten duration.*

- "What is key rate duration and when is it more useful than a single duration number?"
  - *Key rate duration measures sensitivity to yield changes at specific maturities (2y, 5y, 10y, 30y). More useful when the portfolio has non-parallel exposure to the curve — e.g., a barbell.*

- "Why does convexity matter more for longer-dated bonds?"
  - *The price-yield curve becomes more curved as maturity increases; small errors in duration hedging compound over longer time horizons. Convexity adjustment becomes material for 20-30y bonds.*

---

### Derivatives

- "What's the difference between delta and probability of expiring in-the-money?"
  - *Delta ≈ probability of expiring ITM only under risk-neutral measure (Black-Scholes). In practice, delta includes discounting and is not exactly the real-world probability. For deep ITM options, delta → 1 but real probability may be lower if vol is high.*

- "Explain vega risk vs gamma risk. When does each dominate?"
  - *Vega: sensitivity to implied vol level (dominates for longer-dated options, far from expiry). Gamma: sensitivity to changes in delta as spot moves (dominates near expiry, especially for short-dated ATM options).*

- "What's the difference between historical vol and implied vol? Which one do you trade?"
  - *Historical (realized) vol: computed from past price changes. Implied vol: extracted from current option prices via Black-Scholes inversion. You trade implied vol; the vol risk premium is the difference between the two.*

- "A call option has a delta of 0.5 and the stock moves up $1. The new delta is 0.55. What is the gamma?"
  - *Gamma = change in delta / change in spot = (0.55 - 0.50) / $1 = 0.05.*

- "What is pin risk and when does it appear?"
  - *Pin risk: when an option's strike price equals the underlying at expiry, creating uncertainty about whether it expires ITM or OTM. Market makers face gamma explosion risk; underlying may be manipulated to pin the strike.*

- "Explain the difference between a variance swap and a volatility swap."
  - *Variance swap pays (realized variance - strike variance) × notional. Vol swap pays (realized vol - strike vol) × notional. Variance swaps are more common because they can be replicated with a portfolio of options; vol swaps require a convexity adjustment.*

- "What is the vol surface and why is it not flat in practice?"
  - *Vol surface: implied vol for each (strike, expiry) combination. Not flat because of volatility smile/skew — supply/demand for OTM puts (insurance) drives up put-implied vol, and the market prices jump risk not captured by Black-Scholes.*

- "You are long a straddle going into an earnings announcement. Vol collapses after earnings. What happened?"
  - *Vol crush: implied vol was elevated before the event (premium for uncertainty). After the announcement removes uncertainty, IV collapses — you lose on vega even if the stock moves. The move needs to exceed the vol crush for the straddle to be profitable.*

---

### Credit

- "What's the difference between spread duration and interest rate duration?"
  - *Interest rate duration: sensitivity to risk-free yield changes. Spread duration: sensitivity to credit spread changes. A corporate bond has both; a Treasury has only interest rate duration.*

- "Explain the difference between recovery rate and recovery value."
  - *Recovery rate: fraction of par recovered in default (e.g., 40%). Recovery value: dollar amount recovered. A $1,000 bond with 40% recovery rate has a recovery value of $400. CDS pricing uses recovery rate.*

- "What is a credit default swap and how does it differ from a bond short?"
  - *CDS: buyer pays periodic premium; seller pays par minus recovery if credit event. Bond short: borrow and sell bond, profit if price falls. CDS is unfunded (no upfront capital); bond short requires borrowing. CDS triggers on defined credit events; bond short profits from any price decline.*

- "What is the difference between first-lien and second-lien debt in a restructuring?"
  - *Absolute priority rule: first-lien creditors are paid out first from asset liquidation; second-lien holders receive what remains. In practice, negotiated recoveries may deviate from strict priority.*

- "Explain the difference between distressed debt and regular HY investing."
  - *Regular HY: company is solvent, you earn carry and spread compression. Distressed: company is near default or in default; analysis shifts to recovery value, liquidation analysis, and the restructuring process. Return comes from the restructuring outcome, not coupon.*

- "What is a covenant-lite loan and what risk does it introduce?"
  - *Cov-lite: lacks maintenance covenants (e.g., minimum interest coverage ratio); borrower cannot be forced into restructuring for financial deterioration alone, only for non-payment. Increases duration of distress before detection and reduces creditor leverage.*

- "What is a toggle PIK note and when would a company issue one?"
  - *PIK (payment-in-kind): company can pay interest in additional debt instead of cash. Toggle: company chooses cash or PIK each period. Issued when cash flow is uncertain; preserves optionality but increases leverage over time.*

---

### FX

- "What's the difference between covered and uncovered interest parity?"
  - *Covered: hedged with forward contract; guaranteed no arbitrage (forward rate = spot × interest rate differential). Uncovered: no hedge; expects exchange rate to adjust to offset rate differential; an assumption, not a guaranteed relationship.*

- "Explain forward points. Are they determined by spot rate expectations?"
  - *Forward points = forward rate - spot rate. Determined entirely by interest rate differential (cost-of-carry), not by expectations. F = S × (1 + r_d) / (1 + r_f). Forward points are NOT a forecast of where spot will be.*

- "What is the carry trade risk-reward and what causes it to unwind violently?"
  - *Carry: borrow in low-rate currency, invest in high-rate currency, earn the rate differential. Unwind trigger: risk-off event, correlation spike across carry pairs, stop-losses cluster at same levels, liquidity dries up, crowded trade reverses simultaneously.*

- "Distinguish real effective exchange rate (REER) from nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)."
  - *NEER: trade-weighted basket of nominal exchange rates. REER: NEER adjusted for relative inflation between countries. REER is a better measure of competitiveness.*

- "What is the J-curve effect?"
  - *After currency depreciation, the trade deficit initially worsens (import costs rise before export volumes adjust), then improves (exporters gain competitiveness). The path traces a J-shape in time.*

- "Explain the carry-to-vol ratio and how it is used in FX."
  - *Carry-to-vol = interest rate differential / implied vol. Measures compensation per unit of vol risk. High ratio = attractive carry trade. Used to rank currency pairs for carry allocation.*

- "What is a non-deliverable forward (NDF) and when is it used?"
  - *NDF: forward contract on a currency that cannot be freely converted offshore (e.g., CNY, INR, BRL). Settled in USD at the fixing rate; no physical delivery. Used for hedging EM currency exposure where onshore markets are restricted.*

---

### Rates (Precision)

- "What is the difference between the fed funds rate and SOFR?"
  - *Fed funds: overnight unsecured lending rate between banks (credit risk included). SOFR: overnight secured rate (repo, collateralized by Treasuries); no credit risk premium. SOFR replaced LIBOR as the benchmark risk-free rate.*

- "Explain what 'rolling down the curve' means and when it generates positive return."
  - *A bond's yield falls as time passes and it moves toward a shorter maturity, where the yield curve is lower (normal curve). The price rises mechanically. Works best in steep, stable yield curves; fails if curve flattens or inverts.*

- "What is the difference between the primary and secondary mortgage market?"
  - *Primary: original loan between borrower and originating bank. Secondary: bank sells loan to GSE (Fannie/Freddie) or securitizes it; allows banks to recycle capital and originate more loans.*

- "Define the term premium in bond yields."
  - *Term premium: extra compensation demanded for holding long-duration bonds vs. rolling short-term instruments. It is unobservable and must be estimated (e.g., ACM model). It can be negative if investors prefer long duration for ALM reasons.*

- "What is a repo agreement and who uses it?"
  - *Repo: sale of securities with agreement to repurchase at higher price (the difference is the repo rate). Used by banks and dealers to finance securities inventory; used by hedge funds for leverage; used by central banks for monetary policy.*

---

### Macro (Precision)

- "What's the difference between headline and core inflation?"
  - *Headline: all items CPI, including food and energy. Core: excludes food and energy (more volatile). Central banks focus on core as a signal of underlying inflation trend.*

- "Explain the difference between the neutral rate and the terminal rate."
  - *Neutral (r*): theoretical rate that neither stimulates nor restricts growth; unobservable. Terminal rate: the endpoint of the current hiking cycle; where the Fed expects to stop. Terminal rate may be above or below neutral depending on whether tightening is needed.*

- "What is the difference between M1, M2, and M3 money supply?"
  - *M1: most liquid (cash, demand deposits). M2: M1 + savings deposits, money market funds, CDs under $100k. M3: M2 + large deposits, institutional money markets (discontinued in U.S. 2006). Broad money growth signals inflation pressure.*

- "Distinguish fiscal policy from monetary policy transmission mechanisms."
  - *Monetary: operates through interest rates, asset prices, exchange rate, credit conditions. Fiscal: direct government spending increases aggregate demand; tax cuts raise disposable income. Monetary acts with a lag; fiscal can be faster but requires legislative approval.*

- "What is a liquidity trap and how does it affect monetary policy effectiveness?"
  - *When rates near zero, further cuts have no stimulative effect; agents hoard cash, expecting deflation. Conventional monetary policy is exhausted; QE and forward guidance are substitutes, but may also be ineffective if expectations are deeply anchored.*

- "Explain the difference between a solvency crisis and a liquidity crisis."
  - *Liquidity crisis: entity has assets exceeding liabilities but cannot meet short-term obligations (cash flow mismatch). Solvency crisis: liabilities exceed assets; entity is fundamentally insolvent. Distinction is critical — central banks should lend to illiquid but not insolvent institutions.*

---

### Equities (Precision)

- "What is the difference between enterprise value and equity value?"
  - *EV = equity value + debt - cash. EV represents the value of the whole business; equity value is the residual after debtholders are paid. EV-based multiples (EV/EBITDA) are capital structure neutral.*

- "Explain the difference between trailing P/E and forward P/E. Which is more useful?"
  - *Trailing: based on last 12 months actual earnings. Forward: based on next 12 months consensus estimates. Forward P/E is more useful for valuation since it reflects future earnings power, but it depends on estimate accuracy.*

- "What is the difference between book value and market value of equity?"
  - *Book value: accounting value (assets minus liabilities on balance sheet). Market value: price × shares outstanding. P/B ratio compares them; high P/B implies market expects returns above cost of equity.*

- "Distinguish between systematic and idiosyncratic risk in a portfolio context."
  - *Systematic (beta) risk: market-wide risk that cannot be diversified away. Idiosyncratic (alpha) risk: stock-specific risk that diversification reduces to near zero. CAPM only compensates for systematic risk.*

## 3. Classification Bank

These questions test whether the learner can categorize concepts correctly. Good answers identify the category AND explain what defines membership in that category.

---

### Risk Type Classification

- "Classify the following as primarily duration risk, credit risk, or liquidity risk: (a) holding a 30y Treasury, (b) holding CCC-rated bonds, (c) holding a large position in a thinly-traded municipal bond."
  - *a) Duration risk. b) Credit risk. c) Liquidity risk.*

- "A hedge fund holds leveraged positions in repo-funded Treasuries. What types of risk does it face?"
  - *Duration risk (rates move), liquidity risk (repo not rolled), leverage risk (margin call), counterparty risk (repo counterparty fails).*

- "Classify these risks: basis risk, rollover risk, settlement risk, counterparty risk."
  - *Basis: hedge doesn't perfectly offset position. Rollover: inability to refinance maturing debt. Settlement: trade fails to settle (cash or securities not delivered). Counterparty: other party in contract defaults before settlement.*

- "Is volatility risk a type of market risk or a separate category? Defend your answer."
  - *Vol risk is a subset of market risk but often treated separately because it has its own term structure, surface, and instruments. Greeks (vega, volga) are specific to vol exposure.*

- "A bank holds loans on its balance sheet. It also sells protection via CDS. Classify the risks in each position."
  - *Loans: credit risk, liquidity risk (illiquid asset), interest rate risk. CDS protection seller: credit risk (must pay on default), market risk (CDS spread moves), counterparty risk.*

- "Classify model risk: is it operational risk or market risk?"
  - *Model risk is typically classified as operational risk (risk of incorrect model output leading to losses), though it manifests through market positions. Basel III includes it under operational risk.*

- "A company has floating-rate debt. It swaps to fixed. Before the swap, what risk did it face? After?"
  - *Before: interest rate risk (rising rates increase interest expense). After swap: credit risk of swap counterparty, and mark-to-market risk on the swap itself. Net exposure changes from floating to fixed.*

---

### Instrument Classification

- "Which of these are money market instruments vs capital market instruments: repo, commercial paper, T-bill, corporate bond, swap, future, option?"
  - *Money market: repo, commercial paper, T-bill (short-term, <1 year). Capital market: corporate bond. Derivatives (not strictly either): swap, future, option.*

- "Classify these as exchange-traded or OTC: listed equity options, interest rate swaps, T-bond futures, FX forwards, CDX index, variance swaps."
  - *Exchange-traded: listed equity options, T-bond futures. OTC (or cleared OTC): interest rate swaps (now often centrally cleared), FX forwards, CDX (primarily OTC), variance swaps (OTC).*

- "Classify: convertible bond, warrant, preferred equity, CLO equity tranche."
  - *Convertible bond: debt with equity optionality. Warrant: equity option issued by company. Preferred equity: equity with debt-like fixed payments, priority over common. CLO equity: most junior tranche of structured credit, high risk, highest potential return.*

- "Which instruments provide positive carry in a normal yield curve environment: long bond, short T-bill, long/short box spread, short bond, long credit, long equity?"
  - *Positive carry: long bond (earn coupon vs. funding), long credit (earn spread), long equity (earn earnings yield). Negative carry: short bond (pay coupon), short T-bill (depends on funding). Box spread: minimal carry if properly executed.*

- "Classify these credit instruments by seniority in liquidation: senior secured loan, senior unsecured bond, subordinated bond, convertible bond, preferred equity, common equity."
  - *Seniority order: senior secured loan → senior unsecured → subordinated → convertible (typically subordinated) → preferred equity → common equity.*

---

### Pattern Recognition

- "This trade makes money if the curve steepens. What other trades have similar payoff profiles?"
  - *Long 2s10s steepener (receive 2y fixed, pay 10y fixed). Long bank stocks (banks earn net interest margin on steep curves). Short duration in long end, long duration in short end. Long swaptions that profit from curve moves.*

- "What do carry trades in FX, credit, and rates have in common?"
  - *All: earn a yield premium by accepting risk; profit from stable or trending environments; lose violently in risk-off or volatility spike events; tend to be crowded; correlation across carry strategies rises in crises.*

- "A trade is long gamma, short theta. What types of instruments express this payoff?"
  - *Long options (any type): you pay theta (time decay) daily, but gamma means you profit from large moves in either direction. Long straddles, strangles, or any long option position.*

- "This macro scenario causes oil to rise, gold to rise, and equities to fall simultaneously. What scenario fits?"
  - *Stagflationary supply shock (e.g., geopolitical disruption to oil supply): inflation rises (gold and oil up), growth falls (equities down). Classic 1970s-style playbook.*

- "A volatility selling strategy shows consistent small gains for years, then loses years of profits in one month. What category of risk did it have?"
  - *Tail risk / short gamma strategy. These strategies harvest the vol risk premium in calm markets but suffer catastrophic losses in vol spikes. Similar to writing insurance.*

- "Classify the following as relative value or directional trades: long/short equity pairs, long credit index, 2s10s steepener, long gold, short EUR/USD."
  - *Relative value: long/short equity pairs (market neutral), 2s10s steepener (curve spread). Directional: long credit index, long gold, short EUR/USD.*

- "What do the following have in common: convertible arbitrage, capital structure arbitrage, CDS-bond basis trade?"
  - *All are arbitrage strategies exploiting mispricings between related instruments on the same issuer's capital structure. All require careful carry and financing analysis. All carry hidden tail risks (liquidity, basis, crowding).*

## 4. Variation Bank

Each topic has an original concept plus variations that test adaptation of the same framework to different regimes or instruments.

---

### Yield Curve

- **Original:** Normal upward-sloping yield curve interpretation
  - Long rates higher than short rates. Reflects term premium and growth expectations. Investors demand more yield to lock up capital for longer. Banks earn positive carry (borrow short, lend long). Standard framework for most central bank regimes.

- **Variation 1:** Inverted curve
  - Short rates exceed long rates. Historically the most reliable recession predictor (negative term premium). Markets pricing in rate cuts — long bonds rally relative to short. Bank NIM compresses. Not all inversions are equal: driven by policy tightening (bad for economy) vs. safe-haven demand for long bonds (less dire).

- **Variation 2:** Humped curve
  - Intermediate maturities (5-7y) have the highest yields. Belly of curve pricing in peak policy uncertainty. Market is not sure when easing begins. Optimal duration is in the wings (short or long), not belly. Less common than flat or inverted.

- **Variation 3:** Bear flattener vs. bull flattener
  - Bear flattener: both yields rise, but short end rises more (Fed hiking cycle). Bull flattener: both yields fall, but long end falls more (growth concerns, flight to quality in long bonds). Same shape, different causes and implications for risk assets.

- **Variation 4:** Japanese yield curve (YCC regime)
  - BOJ pins 10y JGB at a fixed target (e.g., 0%). Curve shape is policy-determined, not market-determined. JGB market loses price discovery. Foreigners avoid JGBs; domestic institutions forced to hold. When YCC is eventually abandoned, violent repricing occurs.

---

### Carry Trade

- **Original:** Classic FX carry (buy high-yield, sell low-yield)
  - Buy AUD, sell JPY. Earn the interest rate differential as daily carry. Risk: AUD/JPY can collapse if risk-off event causes JPY to strengthen (carry unwind). Sharpe ratio looks good in calm markets; skewed negatively in crises.

- **Variation 1:** Rates carry (roll-down the curve)
  - Buy a 5y bond, hold it as it ages to a 4y bond and rolls to lower yield on a steep curve. Earn coupon plus price appreciation from rolling down. Most profitable in steep, stable curves. Requires stable rates — hedged carry via swaps or futures.

- **Variation 2:** Credit carry (buy HY, hedge duration)
  - Buy HY bonds, hedge rate risk with Treasury shorts or swaps. Earn credit spread as carry. Risk is credit deterioration, not rates. Distinguishes credit carry from rate carry.

- **Variation 3:** Commodity carry (contango = negative carry)
  - In contango, futures prices are above spot; rolling a long position forward costs money (negative carry). In backwardation, rolling generates profit (positive carry). Commodity carry is often negative for commodity indices.

- **Variation 4:** Carry unwind scenario
  - Triggers: vol spike, risk-off event, correlation breakdown, crowding revealed, margin calls. All carry trades share crowded positioning; when one unwinds, correlated positions unwind simultaneously. Liquidity evaporates as everyone is on the same side.

---

### Options Pricing

- **Original:** Standard Black-Scholes for equity options
  - Assumes log-normal returns, constant vol, no jumps, continuous trading. Inputs: S, K, T, r, σ. Outputs: theoretical price and Greeks. Works reasonably for short-dated near-ATM equity options.

- **Variation 1:** Rate options (swaptions, caps, floors)
  - Use SABR or normal vol model (Bachelier) when rates can be zero or negative — log-normal is inappropriate. Swaption vol is quoted as normal vol (bps) or lognormal vol (%). Different vol surface dynamics than equity.

- **Variation 2:** FX options
  - Two interest rates (domestic and foreign) enter pricing. Delta convention differs (spot delta vs. forward delta). Vol surface expressed as ATM, risk reversal (RR), and butterfly (BF) combinations. Carry affects forward, which affects moneyness.

- **Variation 3:** Commodity options
  - Include convenience yield in the model (cost-of-carry model). Convenience yield reflects value of holding physical commodity. Options on futures are standard; Black's formula (not Black-Scholes) uses futures price directly. Vol surface reflects supply disruption risk asymmetrically.

- **Variation 4:** Credit options / CDS options
  - Jump-to-default risk dominates; standard vol models break down. Binary outcomes (default or not) require structural or reduced-form models. Implied vol in credit options is often quoted as spread vol. Counterparty risk in the option itself must be priced.

---

### Volatility Regimes

- **Original:** Low vol, trend-following environment
  - Realized vol below implied vol; vol sellers earn steady premium. Momentum strategies work. Carry trades stable. Risk parity strategies perform well. Central banks credible and predictable.

- **Variation 1:** Vol spike, mean-reversion environment
  - Implied vol above realized vol; opportunistic vol buying. Value strategies outperform. Carry trades lose money. Fast-moving markets favor gamma over theta. Short vol positions face margin calls.

- **Variation 2:** Vol of vol spike
  - Uncertainty about vol itself rises. Vega hedges become unstable. Vol surface becomes unreliable. Variance swaps and tail risk instruments diverge from standard options pricing. Correlation across assets rises.

- **Variation 3:** Sustained high-vol regime (e.g., GFC, COVID crash)
  - Correlation approaches 1 across all risky assets. Diversification fails. Funding liquidity becomes dominant risk. Safe havens (Treasuries, gold, JPY) benefit. Vol surface inverts (near-term vol > long-term vol).

- **Variation 4:** Artificially suppressed vol (e.g., pre-2018, pre-COVID)
  - Central bank put suppresses realized vol. Short vol strategies crowded. Risk of sudden vol normalization is severe. XIV (inverse VIX) ETF blowup (Feb 2018) is the canonical example of suppressed vol regime collapse.

---

### Credit Cycle

- **Original:** Mid-cycle credit expansion
  - Spreads tightening. Issuance surging. Defaults low. LBO activity rising. Covenant quality deteriorating. Risk appetite high. Classic "reach for yield" behavior.

- **Variation 1:** Late cycle
  - Spreads at tights, new issue concessions thin. Cov-lite prevalence at peak. Leverage ratios elevated. Some canaries: rising HY-to-IG ratio of issuance, rising PIK notes, CLO equity tranche demand falling. Risk/reward deteriorating.

- **Variation 2:** Early distress
  - Spreads begin widening, first in CCC tier. Refinancing risk emerges. Distressed ratio (bonds >1000bps OAS) rises. Defaults begin ticking up. Selective HY shorts profitable.

- **Variation 3:** Full distress / restructuring wave
  - Defaults surge. Recovery rates fall (supply of defaulted paper exceeds distressed investors). CLO OC tests fail, forcing deleveraging. Secondary loan prices collapse. Distressed-for-control investors accumulate positions.

- **Variation 4:** Recovery / spread tightening
  - Central bank backstop (e.g., Fed corporate bond buying in 2020). Fiscal stimulus boosts revenues. Technicals improve (supply absorbed). New issuance used to extend maturities, reducing near-term default risk. Fallen angels are eventually upgraded.

---

### Monetary Policy Transmission

- **Original:** Standard rate cut transmission
  - Fed cuts → short rates fall → borrowing costs fall → investment rises → consumption rises → employment rises → GDP grows. Standard textbook with 6-18 month lag.

- **Variation 1:** Zero lower bound (ZLB) scenario
  - Rates cannot go (far) below zero. Conventional transmission blocked. Shift to QE (asset purchases), forward guidance, and in some cases yield curve control. Fiscal policy becomes more important.

- **Variation 2:** Negative rate policy (NIRP)
  - Some central banks (ECB, BOJ, SNB) went below zero. Bank profitability squeeze (charging depositors is difficult). Currency depreciation is primary transmission mechanism. Effectiveness disputed; possibly counterproductive for bank lending.

- **Variation 3:** Quantitative tightening (QT)
  - Reverse of QE: Fed reduces balance sheet. Passive (letting bonds mature) or active (outright sales). Tightens financial conditions by raising term premium. Drains bank reserves, potentially tightening repo markets. Difficult to calibrate — 2019 repo crisis is the cautionary tale.

- **Variation 4:** Fiscal dominance
  - When fiscal deficits are so large that monetary policy is subordinated to debt management. Central bank cannot raise rates aggressively because government debt service would become unmanageable. Inflation potentially un-anchorable. Classic in EM; risk for developed markets at high debt-to-GDP ratios.

---

### Currency Crisis Anatomy

- **Original:** Classic balance-of-payments crisis
  - Country runs current account deficit funded by foreign capital. Capital outflows begin (triggered by growth slowdown, political risk, or external shock). Central bank deploys reserves to defend currency. Reserves depleted. Currency collapses.

- **Variation 1:** Self-fulfilling speculative attack (Krugman-Obstfeld model)
  - Speculators attack a pegged currency en masse even if fundamentals are marginal. Soros vs. Bank of England (1992) is the canonical example. Once speculation reaches critical mass, peg is mathematically unsustainable.

- **Variation 2:** Sudden stop
  - External financing abruptly withdrawn (EM-specific). Capital account reverses rapidly. Country cannot refinance current account deficit. Currency and assets crash together. Often triggered by global risk-off event, not domestic factors alone.

- **Variation 3:** Debt currency mismatch crisis
  - Country or corporates have USD-denominated debts but local-currency revenues. Depreciation raises debt burden, triggering defaults, which cause more depreciation. Asia 1997-98, Latin America 2000s. IMF bailout conditions exacerbate recession.

- **Variation 4:** Reserve currency crisis (theoretical)
  - USD as reserve currency means U.S. runs persistent current account deficits (Triffin dilemma). If reserve status erodes, demand for USD assets falls. Treasury yields rise, dollar weakens. No historical precedent for orderly reserve currency transition.

---

### Inflation Regimes

- **Original:** Low, stable inflation (2% target regime)
  - TIPS breakevens anchored near 2%. Central bank credibility intact. Real rates reflect growth, not inflation distortion. Standard fixed income pricing applies.

- **Variation 1:** Transitory inflation spike
  - Supply-side shock (pandemic, supply chain) drives brief inflation surge. Central bank looks through it. Breakevens rise but long-run expectations remain anchored. Error risk: if central bank wrong about 'transitory,' expectations unanchor.

- **Variation 2:** Persistent above-target inflation
  - Hiking cycle required. Real rates rise sharply. P/E compression in equities. Duration destruction in long bonds. Commodity assets outperform. TIPS outperform nominal Treasuries if real yield doesn't rise too fast.

- **Variation 3:** Deflation / disinflation trap
  - Japan 1990s-2010s. Nominal rates near zero; real rates positive and high (choking growth). Debt deflation spiral (Fisher effect): real debt burden rises, causing deleveraging, causing more deflation. Cash outperforms. Duration assets outperform if bought correctly.

- **Variation 4:** Stagflation
  - High inflation + low/negative growth simultaneously. No good monetary policy response: hiking crushes growth; cutting worsens inflation. 1970s playbook. Gold, commodities, real assets outperform. Both stocks and bonds underperform in real terms.

## 5. Mock Interview Simulation Patterns

These scripts govern interviewer behavior in Recall Mode sessions. The interviewer maintains neutral, probing persona throughout. Responses should never volunteer information, always extract it.

---

### Opening Prompts (Round 1)

These establish the topic without revealing what level of depth is expected.

- "Tell me about [concept]."
- "Walk me through how [instrument] works."
- "Explain [market relationship] to me."
- "Describe what happens when [event] occurs."
- "How would you think about [scenario]?"
- "What's your framework for understanding [market dynamic]?"
- "Give me your mental model for [topic]."
- "How does [mechanism] actually work in practice?"

---

### Neutral Acknowledgments (Rounds 2-5)

Use these to keep the candidate talking without confirming or denying correctness. The candidate should never know whether they are on the right track.

- "Okay."
- "Got it."
- "Mm-hmm."
- "Go on."
- "And then?"
- "Interesting."
- "What else?"
- "Keep going."
- "Right, and?"
- "And the implication of that is?"
- "How does that follow from what you said before?"
- "What happens next?"
- "And beyond that?"

---

### Probing Pushback (Rounds 3-6)

Use these when the answer is incomplete, imprecise, or plausibly wrong. Do not reveal the correct answer.

**Precision challenges:**
- "Can you be more precise about that?"
- "What exactly do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "You said [phrase]. Can you define that more specifically?"
- "How would you quantify that?"

**Correctness challenges:**
- "Are you sure about that?"
- "What if I told you that's not quite right?"
- "Walk me through the math on that."
- "Can you give me a specific example that supports that claim?"
- "That's one way to look at it. What's the other side?"
- "What would a skeptic say about that argument?"

**Completeness challenges:**
- "What are you leaving out?"
- "What else could be going on?"
- "Is that the only explanation?"
- "What's the second-order effect?"
- "What does that imply for other asset classes?"

---

### Wrong-Answer Probes (Rounds 3-5)

Use when the candidate has given an answer that is likely wrong. Probe without correcting.

- "Interesting. Walk me through the logic on that step by step."
- "Can you give me a concrete example of when that would be true?"
- "If that were the case, what would we expect to see in markets right now?"
- "How does that square with [contradictory observation]?"
- "A lot of people would disagree with that. What's your response?"
- "Let me push back. In [specific scenario], that wouldn't hold. How do you reconcile that?"

---

### Regime and Variation Challenges (Rounds 4-6)

Use to test whether the candidate can adapt their framework, not just recite it.

- "What if rates were negative? Does your framework still hold?"
- "That's the textbook answer. What happens in practice when there's a liquidity crunch?"
- "What if the central bank has lost credibility? How does that change your analysis?"
- "You described a normal market. What happens if this is an EM economy instead?"
- "What if the move is 10x larger than you assumed? Does the direction of impact change?"
- "How does your answer change if the time horizon is 1 week vs. 5 years?"
- "What if you're wrong about the direction of causality?"

---

### Synthesis Prompts (Round 6-7)

Use near the end to test whether the candidate can integrate what they've said.

- "Okay. Now summarize the key takeaway in one sentence."
- "If you had to put this trade on tomorrow, what would you do first?"
- "What's the single most important thing to monitor in this situation?"
- "What would change your view?"
- "What's the bear case for your analysis?"
- "If you're right, what does the payoff look like? If you're wrong, what does the loss look like?"
- "What's the risk you haven't mentioned yet?"
- "In one sentence: what is the core mechanism driving this?"

---

### Grading Heuristics (Internal — Not Shown to Candidate)

Use these silently to calibrate feedback after the session:

**Excellent response characteristics:**
- Identifies the primary mechanism correctly and precisely
- Acknowledges second-order effects unprompted
- Handles a follow-up variation without breaking the framework
- Uses specific examples or numerical intuition
- Identifies what they don't know

**Adequate response characteristics:**
- Gets the directional answer right
- Uses correct terminology
- Identifies the primary mechanism, misses secondary effects
- Needs probing to reach complete answer

**Poor response characteristics:**
- Confuses correlated but distinct concepts
- Gives textbook definition without connecting to market behavior
- Cannot extend framework to a variation
- Defends wrong answers when probed instead of updating
- Vague language without quantitative grounding
