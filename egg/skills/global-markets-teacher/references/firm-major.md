# Energy Major Profile

## Representative Firms
ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, TotalEnergies, ConocoPhillips, Equinor

## Business Model
- Integrated oil & gas: upstream (exploration, production) + downstream (refining, marketing)
- Trading desk: optimize physical flows, manage price risk, opportunistic trading
- Hedging: protect capital expenditure and revenue streams
- Energy transition: renewable investments, carbon trading
- Scale: massive balance sheets, long-term capital allocation

## What They Test In Interviews
- Energy market fundamentals: oil, gas, power, carbon
- Upstream/downstream integration understanding
- Risk management and hedging rationale
- Commercial trading skills
- Understanding of energy transition and ESG
- Quantitative skills for pricing and risk
- Geopolitical awareness (OPEC, sanctions, energy policy)

## Interview Emphasis by Section (M1-M5)
- M1 (Resume): 10% — why energy, technical background, industry awareness
- M2 (Market Views): 20% — energy market specific, OPEC dynamics, energy transition
- M3 (Trade Pitch): 20% — hedging rationale, exposure management angle
- M4 (Scenario): 30% — energy supply chain cascade, geopolitical scenario impact
- M5 (Brain Teaser): 20% — energy-specific Fermi problems, refinery economics

## Culture & Values
- Engineering-driven, safety-first culture
- Long-term planning horizon (decades for upstream projects)
- Risk-averse relative to trading houses
- Global operations, diverse workforce
- Structured career progression

## What Makes a Candidate Stand Out
- Deep understanding of oil/gas value chain
- Knowledge of refining margins (crack spreads), gas basis
- Awareness of energy transition and carbon markets
- Understanding of hedging from corporate perspective
- Geopolitical insight (OPEC+, Russia, Middle East, US shale)

## Common Mistakes
- Not understanding the difference between a major and a trading house
- Ignoring the hedging/risk management angle (majors trade to hedge, not speculate)
- Not knowing upstream vs downstream basics
- Being unaware of energy transition commitments
- Treating it like a pure financial trading role
