# Crypto & Digital Assets

## 1. Core Concepts

### Bitcoin & Proof of Work
- Bitcoin mechanics: UTXO model, blocks, mining, difficulty adjustment
- Halving cycle: supply reduction every ~4 years, impact on price
- BTC as "digital gold": store of value thesis, scarcity argument
- Mining economics: hash rate, energy costs, breakeven price
- Bitcoin dominance as a market indicator
- Lightning Network: Layer 2 scaling

### Ethereum & Smart Contracts
- Account-based model vs UTXO
- Smart contracts: programmable money, EVM
- Gas fees: gas limit, gas price, base fee (EIP-1559)
- Proof of Stake: staking, validators, slashing
- ETH as productive asset: staking yield
- Layer 2 scaling: rollups (optimistic, ZK), sidechains

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- Automated Market Makers (AMMs): Uniswap, constant product formula (x*y=k)
- Lending protocols: Aave, Compound — overcollateralization, liquidation
- Yield farming: liquidity mining, LP incentives
- Where does DeFi yield come from? (trading fees, borrowing demand, token emissions)
- Risks: smart contract risk, oracle risk, impermanent loss, composability risk
- Real yield vs inflationary yield

### Stablecoins
- Types: fiat-backed (USDT, USDC), crypto-backed (DAI), algorithmic (failed: UST)
- Peg mechanics: how each type maintains $1
- Reserve composition and transparency
- Depeg risk: cascade effects, bank run dynamics
- Regulatory landscape

### Market Structure
- Centralized exchanges (CEX): Binance, Coinbase — order book, matching
- Decentralized exchanges (DEX): on-chain order execution
- Perpetual futures: funding rate mechanism, no expiry
- Basis trade: spot vs perp, cash and carry
- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value): front-running, sandwich attacks
- OTC desks, dark pools

### Regulation
- SEC vs CFTC jurisdiction: securities vs commodities
- Howey test for crypto securities
- MiCA (EU regulation)
- Spot ETF approvals: BTC, ETH
- Tax treatment: capital gains, staking income
- Travel rule, KYC/AML requirements

## 2. Key Relationships
- BTC halving → supply shock → historically bullish (but priced in debate)
- Funding rate: positive = longs pay shorts (bullish sentiment), negative = opposite
- Basis = Futures - Spot (annualized for cash and carry yield)
- ETH staking yield as crypto "risk-free rate"
- BTC dominance: rises in risk-off, falls in altcoin season
- Correlation: BTC-SPX correlation has increased post-2020

## 3. Trading Strategies
- Cash and carry: long spot, short futures/perp, earn basis
- Funding rate arbitrage: earn positive funding by holding opposite position
- Momentum/trend following: crypto tends to trend
- Mean reversion: BTC dominance, ETH/BTC ratio
- DeFi yield strategies: liquidity provision, lending
- Event-driven: halving, ETF approval, regulatory decisions
- Cross-exchange arbitrage

## 4. Risk Factors
- Extreme volatility (50%+ drawdowns normal)
- Regulatory risk (bans, classification changes)
- Smart contract risk (hacks, exploits)
- Counterparty risk (exchange failures — FTX)
- Liquidity risk (altcoins, off-hours)
- Correlation regime shifts
- Stablecoin depeg contagion

## 5. Interview Focus Areas
- "How does Bitcoin work?" (technical understanding)
- "Where does DeFi yield come from?" (key question — many can't answer)
- "What's your view on crypto as an asset class?"
- "Explain the basis trade in crypto"
- "How would you hedge crypto exposure?"
- "What risks concern you most in crypto?"

## 6. Cross-Asset Connections
- Crypto → Rates: real rates and BTC (negative correlation argument)
- Crypto → Equities: increasing correlation, risk-on/off behavior
- Crypto → FX: stablecoins as dollar demand, EM capital flight
- Crypto → Commodities: energy consumption (mining), digital commodity debate
- Crypto → Macro: liquidity conditions, QE/QT impact
