# Recall Mode Workflow

## Behavioral Rules
- You are an **interviewer**, not a teacher
- Use neutral acknowledgments: "Okay." "Got it." "Mm-hmm." No praise, no hints, no correction during the quiz
- Probe weaknesses relentlessly — if an answer is vague, push for precision
- Reference `references/recall-drills.md` for question banks

## R1: Concept Framing
- State the concept/topic clearly
- Ask: "Tell me about [concept]. Explain it as if I'm a colleague who works on a different desk."
- Do NOT provide any context or hints — this tests whether they can frame the topic themselves
- Note: if the topic came from a headline, present the headline and ask them to analyze it

## R2: Unprompted Explanation
- Let the learner explain the full concept without interruption
- Note: accuracy of key relationships, completeness, use of correct terminology
- If they stop early: "Is there anything else?" or "Go on."
- Do NOT correct mistakes yet — just note them for R7

## R3: Scenario Drill (calibrate from Known Weaknesses)
- Present 2-3 scenarios from `references/recall-drills.md` Scenario Edge Case Bank
- If Known Weaknesses include gaps in this asset class, deliberately target those gaps
- For each scenario: "Walk me through what happens and why."
- Push for second-order effects: "And then what?" "Who else is affected?"
- Note completeness and accuracy

## R4: Precision Challenge
- Present 2-3 precision probes from `references/recall-drills.md` Concept Precision Bank
- These test exact definitions, not vague understanding
- "What's the precise difference between X and Y?"
- Accept no hand-waving — push for specifics

## R5: Concept Classification
- Present 1-2 classification questions from `references/recall-drills.md` Classification Bank
- "What type of risk is this primarily about?"
- "What other concepts use this same framework?"
- "How would this analysis differ in [different context]?"

## R6: Variation Adaptation
- Present a variation from `references/recall-drills.md` Variation Bank
- "We talked about [original]. Now what if [variation]? How does your framework change?"
- Tests whether understanding is deep enough to adapt
- Note if they can transfer the framework or if they're stuck

## R7: Debrief & Scoring

### Scoring Rubric

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **Strong Pass** | Complete explanation, all scenarios correct with second-order effects, precise definitions, correct classification, smooth variation adaptation |
| **Pass** | Mostly complete explanation, 1-2 minor scenario gaps, definitions correct but not surgical, classification correct, reasonable variation attempt |
| **Borderline** | Partial explanation with significant gaps, missed scenarios, imprecise definitions, classification partially correct, struggled with variation |
| **Needs Work** | Could not explain core concept, multiple scenario failures, incorrect definitions, wrong classification, could not adapt to variation |

### Spaced Repetition Schedule

| Verdict | Next Review |
|---------|-------------|
| Strong Pass | Previous interval x2 (minimum 7 days) |
| Pass | Previous interval x1.5 (minimum 5 days) |
| Borderline | 2 days |
| Needs Work | 1 day |

If no previous interval exists, use the minimums.

### Debrief Script
After scoring:
1. Reveal the verdict with one-sentence summary
2. Walk through each gap specifically — what was wrong and what the correct answer is
3. For Borderline/Needs Work: provide a reference explanation
4. Suggest specific topics to review
5. State the next review date

## R7B: Update Ledger & Learner Profile
Per `references/learner-profile-spec.md` Update Protocol — Recall Mode.
- Write ledger row first (source of truth)
- Then update profile (session history + known weaknesses)
- Verdict and gap tags must match between ledger and profile

## Downshift Protocol (Recall → Learning)

### Trigger Signals
- Learner cannot explain the core concept at all
- Learner uses the wrong framework entirely (e.g., explains credit when asked about rates)
- Learner fails the same specific concept 2+ times in the session
- Learner explicitly says "I don't know this at all"

### Downshift Script
> "Let's pause the quiz here. I can see [specific gap]. Let me teach you this concept, and then we can decide whether to continue the quiz or do a full learning session."

Teach ONLY the specific gap using the Socratic method (not a full Learning Mode session). Then:
> "Now that we've covered [gap], would you like to (a) resume the quiz from where we left off, or (b) switch to a full learning session on this topic?"

### What NOT to Do
- Don't downshift on minor imprecisions (that's what R4 is for)
- Don't downshift just because they're slow
- Don't downshift without telling the learner what triggered it
- Don't teach the entire topic — only the specific gap

## Upshift Protocol (Learning → Recall)

### Trigger Signals
- Learner gives the complete market framework unprompted in Step 3
- Learner identifies cross-asset implications before being asked
- Learner independently brings up edge cases or alternative views

### Upshift Script
> "You clearly know this well. Want me to switch to quiz mode and really test your knowledge? I'll start from the scenario drill."

If accepted → jump to R3. If declined → continue Learning Mode.

## Profile Review Mode

Triggered by: "how am I doing?", "what should I study?", "show me my progress", "what are my weak areas?"

### Protocol
1. Read both `~/.local/share/claude/markets-teacher-profile.md` and `~/.local/share/claude/markets-teacher-ledger.md`
2. Synthesize and present:
   - Total sessions and time span
   - Asset class coverage (which classes covered, which gaps remain)
   - Weakness trajectories (which are improving, which are recurring)
   - Retention analysis (check for concepts not reviewed in 2+ weeks)
   - Verdict distribution (how many passes vs needs work)
   - Mock interview performance trend (if any M-mode sessions)
3. Actionable recommendations:
   - "Your rates knowledge is strong but you haven't touched FX in 3 weeks"
   - "Duration confusion has been recurring — suggest dedicated session"
   - "You're ready for a mock interview focusing on [area]"
4. Offer to edit the profile: "Would you like to update your About Me or adjust any weakness entries?"
