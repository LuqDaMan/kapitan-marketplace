# Macro Economics

## 1. Core Concepts

### Economic Growth
- GDP: components (C + I + G + NX), real vs nominal
- Potential GDP and output gap
- Business cycle phases: expansion, peak, contraction, trough
- Leading, coincident, lagging indicators
- Productivity: total factor productivity, labor productivity

### Inflation
- CPI, PCE, PPI: what each measures and differences
- Headline vs core inflation
- Cost-push vs demand-pull inflation
- Inflation expectations: breakevens, surveys (Michigan, SPF), market-implied
- Phillips curve: inflation-unemployment tradeoff (and when it breaks down)
- Wage-price spiral
- Hyperinflation: causes and examples

### Central Banks
- The Fed: dual mandate (employment + price stability), FOMC, dot plot
- ECB: price stability mandate, governing council, fragmentation risk
- BOJ: yield curve control (YCC), ultra-loose policy, yen implications
- BOE: inflation targeting, MPC
- PBoC: managed exchange rate, RRR, MLF, LPR
- Policy tools: fed funds rate, open market operations, discount window
- Unconventional policy: QE, QT, forward guidance, YCC, negative rates

### Monetary Policy
- Taylor rule: rate = r* + 0.5(inflation - target) + 0.5(output gap)
- Neutral rate (r*): where policy is neither stimulative nor restrictive
- Terminal rate: peak of the hiking cycle
- Transmission mechanism: rates → financial conditions → economy
- Lag effects: monetary policy works with 12-18 month lags
- Quantitative easing: how it works, portfolio balance channel
- Quantitative tightening: balance sheet reduction

### Fiscal Policy
- Government spending, taxation, transfer payments
- Fiscal multiplier: when is it large vs small?
- Deficit and debt: deficit/GDP, debt/GDP ratios
- Crowding out vs crowding in
- Fiscal dominance: when fiscal policy constrains monetary policy
- MMT debate

### Economic Indicators
- Leading: PMI, initial claims, building permits, yield curve, stock market
- Coincident: NFP, industrial production, real income, retail sales
- Lagging: unemployment rate, CPI, corporate profits, bank lending
- Market-moving data releases: NFP, CPI, FOMC, GDP, PMI
- Consensus vs actual: the surprise component matters most

### International Macro
- Balance of payments: current account, capital account, financial account
- Twin deficits: fiscal and current account
- Terms of trade: export prices / import prices
- Capital flows: portfolio investment, FDI, hot money
- Global imbalances: US deficit, China surplus, petrodollar recycling
- Dollar hegemony: reserve currency, Triffin dilemma

### Financial Conditions
- Financial conditions indices: Goldman FCI, Chicago Fed FCI
- Components: rates, credit spreads, equity prices, USD, vol
- Transmission: financial conditions → real economy
- Tightening vs easing financial conditions

## 2. Key Relationships & Formulas
- GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
- Fisher equation: nominal rate ≈ real rate + expected inflation
- Taylor rule: i = r* + π + 0.5(π - π*) + 0.5(y - y*)
- Okun's law: 1% above potential GDP → unemployment falls ~0.5%
- Quantity theory: MV = PY
- Budget constraint: G - T = ΔB + ΔM (spending - taxes = bonds + money creation)
- Current account + capital account + financial account = 0

## 3. Trading Implications
- Rate cycle: where are we and what's priced in?
- Inflation surprise: hawkish/dovish repricing
- Growth surprise: risk-on/risk-off
- Policy divergence: cross-country rate and FX implications
- Regime identification: inflation regime → different playbook

## 4. Risk Factors
- Policy error (too tight, too loose)
- Geopolitical shocks
- Financial crisis contagion
- Structural shifts (demographics, technology, climate)
- Black swan events

## 5. Interview Focus Areas
- "Where are we in the business cycle?"
- "What's the Fed going to do and why?"
- "How does monetary policy affect markets?"
- "Walk me through what happens when CPI surprises to the upside"
- "What macro theme are you most focused on right now?"
- "Explain QE and how it works"

## 6. Cross-Asset Connections
- Macro → Rates: policy rates, inflation expectations, term premium
- Macro → FX: policy divergence, growth differentials, capital flows
- Macro → Equities: earnings cycle, discount rates, sector rotation
- Macro → Credit: credit cycle, financial conditions
- Macro → Commodities: demand growth, USD impact, inflation
