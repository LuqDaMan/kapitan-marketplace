# Scenario Analysis Framework

## Overview
How to think through cross-asset impact chains when a market event occurs. This is the core skill tested in M4 of mock interviews and throughout recall mode. The ability to trace first, second, and third-order effects separates good candidates from great ones.

## The Cross-Asset Impact Chain

### Step 1: Identify the Shock
- What changed? (rate decision, data release, geopolitical event, supply shock)
- Was it expected or a surprise? (only the surprise component moves markets)
- What was positioned/priced in before?

### Step 2: First-Order Effects (Direct, Immediate)
- What instrument/market is directly affected?
- Direction and approximate magnitude
- Mechanical effects: stop losses, margin calls, forced liquidation
- Who is caught offside?

### Step 3: Second-Order Effects (Cross-Asset, Minutes to Days)
Transmission channels:
- **Rate channel:** How does this change the discount rate? Affects: equities (growth vs value), credit, FX carry, real estate
- **Credit channel:** Does this change default probabilities? Affects: spreads, bank lending, financial conditions
- **Risk appetite channel:** Does this shift risk-on/risk-off? Affects: EM, HY, equities vs bonds, vol
- **Flow channel:** Does this force rebalancing? Affects: index changes, margin calls, CTA flows, risk parity
- **Currency channel:** Does this change relative monetary policy? Affects: FX crosses, EM, commodity prices
- **Commodity channel:** Does this affect supply/demand? Affects: inflation, producers, consumers

### Step 4: Third-Order Effects (Feedback Loops, Days to Weeks)
- Policy response: will the central bank/government react?
- Market positioning adjustment: consensus shift
- Feedback loops: e.g., currency weakness → inflation → tighter policy → slower growth → more currency weakness
- Contagion: does this spread to other countries/sectors?

### Step 5: Regime Identification
- What regime are we in? (Risk-on, risk-off, inflationary, deflationary, goldilocks)
- Does this event change the regime?
- Different regimes have different playbooks:
  - **Inflationary boom:** stocks up, bonds down, commodities up, USD mixed
  - **Deflationary bust:** stocks down, bonds up, commodities down, USD up (haven)
  - **Goldilocks:** stocks up, bonds stable, vol low, credit tight
  - **Stagflation:** stocks down, bonds down, commodities up, nothing works

### Step 6: Position for It
- Given the chain of effects, where is the best risk/reward?
- What's already priced in vs what isn't?
- What instrument gives the best expression?

## Example Scenario Walkthroughs

### Scenario 1: "Fed surprises with 50bp hike"
Full walkthrough of all 6 steps: rates reaction, curve dynamics, equity impact (growth vs value), credit spread widening, USD strength, EM stress, commodity impact, policy response expectations.

### Scenario 2: "China devalues the yuan by 10%"
Full walkthrough: trade war fears, EM contagion, commodity demand, US Treasury buying (reserves), US inflation import, equity sector impacts, safe haven flows.

### Scenario 3: "Oil goes to $150/barrel"
Full walkthrough: inflation pass-through, central bank response, consumer spending impact, petrodollar recycling, airline/transport costs, EM oil importers vs exporters, political response.

### Scenario 4: "Major European bank announces $50B in losses"
Full walkthrough: contagion fears, credit spreads, bank funding costs, EUR weakness, flight to quality, repo market stress, policy response (ECB backstop), comparison to historical events.

## The "And Then What?" Technique
Always push one level deeper:
- "Rates go up" → And then what? → "Growth stocks fall" → And then what? → "Tech layoffs" → And then what? → "Consumer spending drops" → And then what? → "Fed pauses hiking"

This recursive thinking is what interviewers are testing.

## Common Mistakes in Scenario Analysis

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Stopping at first-order | Always trace to second and third order |
| Ignoring what's priced in | Start with: what does the market expect? |
| Linear thinking only | Consider feedback loops and nonlinearities |
| Forgetting positioning | Who is caught offside? Forced selling? |
| Not identifying the regime | State the regime and whether this changes it |
| Only analyzing one asset class | Always go cross-asset |

## Scoring Scenario Analysis (for Mock Interview M4)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Complete chain (3+ orders), identifies regime, spots non-obvious implications, suggests positioning |
| 4 | Good chain (2+ orders), identifies key cross-asset links, reasonable positioning |
| 3 | First-order correct, some cross-asset, no feedback loops or positioning |
| 2 | Only first-order, misses key cross-asset links |
| 1 | Incorrect first-order or incoherent analysis |
