# Credit

## 1. Core Concepts

### Credit Fundamentals
- Credit risk: probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default
- Credit spread: compensation for bearing credit risk above risk-free rate
- Investment grade (IG) vs high yield (HY): rating scale (AAA to D), fallen angels, rising stars
- Credit analysis framework: business risk, financial risk, structural risk

### Credit Spreads
- Option-adjusted spread (OAS)
- Z-spread: zero-volatility spread
- Asset swap spread
- CDS spread
- Spread duration: sensitivity to spread changes
- Spread compression/widening cycles
- What drives spread moves: fundamentals, technicals, risk appetite

### Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
- Mechanics: protection buyer pays premium, protection seller pays on credit event
- Credit events: bankruptcy, failure to pay, restructuring
- CDS pricing: relationship to bond spread (approximate arbitrage)
- CDS basis: CDS spread minus bond spread — why it exists
- CDS indices: CDX (NA), iTraxx (Europe) — IG and HY
- Single-name CDS vs index CDS
- ISDA documentation, auction process

### Capital Structure
- Seniority: senior secured, senior unsecured, subordinated, mezzanine, equity
- Priority of claims in bankruptcy
- Recovery rates by seniority level
- Capital structure arbitrage: trading across the capital structure
- Structural subordination: holding company vs operating company

### Distressed Debt
- Distressed trading: buying bonds/loans trading below par
- Fulcrum security: where value breaks in the capital structure
- Chapter 11 vs Chapter 7
- DIP financing
- Restructuring: exchange offers, consent solicitations
- Loan-to-own strategies

### Leveraged Finance
- Leveraged loans: senior secured, first lien, second lien
- CLOs: collateralized loan obligations — tranching, waterfall
- High yield bonds: call features, covenants
- Covenant analysis: incurrence vs maintenance covenants
- Leverage ratios: Debt/EBITDA, Net Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage

### Sovereign Credit
- Sovereign risk factors: fiscal position, external balance, institutional strength
- Sovereign ratings and methodology
- Sovereign CDS
- EM vs DM sovereign credit
- Sovereign debt restructuring (collective action clauses)

## 2. Key Relationships & Formulas
- Credit spread ≈ PD × LGD (simplified)
- CDS basis = CDS spread - Bond spread (Z-spread or ASW)
- Recovery rate = 1 - LGD
- Expected loss = PD × LGD × EAD
- Hazard rate: instantaneous default probability
- Risky PV = Risk-free PV × survival probability

## 3. Trading Strategies
- Long/short credit: directional spread trades
- Basis trades: CDS vs bond
- Capital structure arbitrage: debt vs equity, senior vs sub
- Curve trades: short-dated vs long-dated credit
- Index vs single-name: relative value
- Distressed investing: buying below recovery value
- Credit long/short: pair trades within sectors

## 4. Risk Factors
- Default/credit risk, Spread risk
- Recovery rate uncertainty
- Liquidity risk (HY, distressed, EM)
- Concentration risk
- Correlation risk (index tranches)
- Downgrade risk (fallen angel)
- Event risk (LBO, M&A)

## 5. Interview Focus Areas
- "What drives credit spreads?"
- "Explain how a CDS works"
- "Walk me through credit analysis for a company"
- "What's the CDS basis and why does it exist?"
- "How do CLOs work?"
- "What's happening in credit markets?"

## 6. Cross-Asset Connections
- Credit → Rates: risk-free rate component, monetary policy impact
- Credit → Equities: Merton model (equity as call option on assets), capital structure
- Credit → FX: EM sovereign credit and currency risk
- Credit → Commodities: commodity producer creditworthiness
- Credit → Macro: credit cycle, financial conditions
