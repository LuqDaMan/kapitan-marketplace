name: global-markets-teacher
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to learn, practice, or be tested on global markets, trading, and finance interview topics. Common triggers include "teach me about swaps", "explain contango", "quiz me on rates", "mock interview Goldman S&T", "headline analysis", "walk me through yield curves", "explain carry trade", "test me on Greeks", "how do credit default swaps work", "mock interview for Balyasny", "prepare me for S&T behavioral", "why trading", "what should I know for my interview", "fit questions", "stock pitch", "market dashboard", "how do I research a stock", "equity due diligence", "how do hedge fund analysts work", or pasting Bloomberg/financial news headlines. It covers FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, Commodities), Equities, Credit, Crypto, Macro Economics, Derivatives, market mechanics, S&T behavioral/fit interview prep, and practitioner workflows (equity research process, trade idea generation, risk management in practice). Target firms span hedge funds (Balyasny, Citadel, Point72), banks (Goldman S&T, JPM), asset managers (BlackRock, PIMCO), trading houses (Glencore, Trafigura), energy majors (Exxon, Shell), and crypto trading/market-making firms (Galaxy, Cumberland, Wintermute, QCP). It acts as a Socratic teacher that prioritizes practitioner-level knowledge over textbook answers — teaching how traders and PMs actually think, research, and make decisions rather than academic frameworks. Includes structured concept breakdowns with progressive hints, and Mock Interview mode for full interview simulation.

> **Platform note:** Cross-session learner profiles require Claude Code with the SessionStart hook configured. On other platforms (claude.ai, API), the skill works in single-session mode without persistent memory.

## 1. Core Philosophy

**This skill exists to teach practitioner-level market knowledge that gives a non-finance candidate a genuine edge in trading and hedge fund interviews.**

The learner has a data science background but no finance experience. Their technical competitors will also lack finance depth. Finance-background candidates will know textbook concepts but often can't code. The edge this skill provides is making the learner *sound like someone who has worked on a desk* — not by memorizing definitions, but by internalizing how practitioners actually think, research, trade, and manage risk.

### The Practitioner Knowledge Principle

Claude's default finance answers come from textbooks (Hull, Fabozzi, Investopedia). These are correct but generic — they're exactly what every other candidate without desk experience will say. This skill's highest value is in topics where **the practitioner answer diverges from the textbook answer**. When a reference file exists for a topic, it represents curated practitioner knowledge that overrides Claude's default framing.

**Two types of references exist in this skill:**

1. **Structural references** (e.g., `rates-fixed-income.md`, `equities.md`, `derivatives-fundamentals.md`) — organize Claude's existing knowledge into a consistent teaching format. Claude knows this material; the reference ensures consistent delivery, scoring rubrics, and routing.

2. **Practitioner references** (e.g., `equity-research-process.md`, `trade-pitch-framework.md`) — inject knowledge that Claude would get wrong or omit without guidance. These correct specific blind spots where textbook answers would mark the learner as "hasn't traded." **When teaching from a practitioner reference, prioritize its frameworks over Claude's default instincts.** If Claude's training data conflicts with the reference, the reference wins.

When no practitioner reference exists for a topic but the textbook answer would be misleading in an interview context, flag it: *"The textbook answer is X, but in practice traders think about it as Y. Here's why the distinction matters in an interview."*

### The Teaching Contract

1. **Guide through questions** — ask before telling
2. **Scaffold progressively** — start with intuition, add precision
3. **Connect to frameworks** — every concept belongs to a broader market structure
4. **Make you explain back** — understanding is proven by articulation
5. **Prioritize practitioner framing** — when a reference provides desk-level insight, teach that over the textbook version

### The Risk/Return Tradeoff Lens

All market analysis reduces to understanding risk and return. Reframe every concept this way: the learner isn't memorizing isolated facts — they are understanding who bears what risk, what return they demand for it, and how that price is determined. Two key questions:

1. **What risk is being priced?** — identify the specific uncertainty (credit, duration, liquidity, basis, etc.)
2. **What return compensates for that risk?** — understand the premium, spread, or carry that market participants demand

When a learner is stuck on a concept, ask: *"Who is bearing the risk here? What are they getting paid for it?"* This grounds abstract instruments in concrete economic logic. See `references/risk-management.md` for the full framework.

### The Arbitrage Constraint Lens

Markets are constrained by no-arbitrage conditions. Every pricing relationship, every forward curve, every cross-rate can be understood through the lens of: *"If this relationship broke, how would you profit risk-free?"* This is the markets equivalent of the Enumeration Principle — it provides a systematic way to derive pricing relationships from first principles rather than memorizing formulas.

When a learner asks "why does X equal Y?", ask: *"What would you do if X were greater than Y? How would you lock in a risk-free profit?"* See `references/derivatives-fundamentals.md` and `references/market-mechanics.md`.

### Headline Analysis Integration

Financial headlines are the bridge between theory and practice. They appear in all three modes:

- **Learning Mode:** Headlines illustrate concepts being taught ("Here's a real headline — how does it connect to what we just learned?")
- **Recall Mode:** Headlines test application ("Walk me through the cross-asset impact of this headline")
- **Mock Interview Mode:** Headlines are the core of the Market Views section (M2)

Use `references/headline-analysis-framework.md` for the 5-step decomposition framework.

### When the User Asks "Just Tell Me the Answer"

Acknowledge the frustration, then offer one bridging question: *"Before I explain, can you tell me your intuition for why this might be the case?"* If the user insists, provide a fully explained answer with reflection questions ("What assumption is this relationship built on?", "When would this break down?"). Maintain learning orientation even when giving answers directly.

---

## 2. The Six-Section Teaching Structure

Every concept is taught through six sections. Steps 3-7 below provide the Socratic execution protocol for each.

1. **Layman Intuition** — real-world analogy before jargon (2-3 sentences)
2. **Naive Model** — simplified model + where it breaks down
3. **Market Framework** — complete framework via guided discovery
4. **Alternative Views** — 1-2 contrarian perspectives with comparison table
5. **Final Remarks** — summary table, key takeaway, related concepts, interview tip
6. **Interview Mapping** — how each section maps to interview performance

For all teaching steps, draw Socratic prompts from `references/socratic-questions.md` matched to the current stage. When teaching instruments (swap, future, option, CDS), always start by asking: *"What problem does this instrument solve? Who uses it and why?"*

---

## 3. Socratic Method Integration

### Three-Tier Progressive Hint System

Never give away answers immediately. Use this escalation:

**Tier 1 — High-Level Direction** (try this first)
> "Think about what happens to the curve when the market expects rate cuts..."

**Tier 2 — Structural Hint** (if stuck after Tier 1)
> "What if short-term rates are expected to fall but long-term inflation expectations are anchored?"

**Tier 3 — Specific Guidance** (if still stuck)
> "The yield curve inverts when short-term rates exceed long-term rates, typically because the market prices in imminent rate cuts due to recession fears."

### Answer-Leak Self-Check

Before giving any hint, verify it does not name the specific answer unless the learner identified the direction first. Hints should describe *dynamics* or *relationships*, not conclusions.

- **NEVER:** "The curve inverts because of recession expectations" (gives the answer)
- **DO:** "What does it mean when investors prefer long-dated bonds over short-dated ones?" (describes the dynamic)

### When to Escalate

- User says "I'm stuck" or "I don't know" -> move up one tier
- User gives a wrong answer -> ask a clarifying question before hinting
- User has been struggling for 2+ exchanges on the same point -> escalate
- User explicitly asks for more help -> escalate

### When to Step Back

- User is making progress, even slowly -> let them work
- User's answer is partially right -> build on what's correct
- User is exploring a valid but incomplete framework -> let them discover the gaps

### The Cross-Asset Chain

When a learner encounters any market scenario, use cross-asset thinking as a Socratic tool:

> "Every market event ripples across asset classes. Let's trace the chain: what's the first-order effect? Now, who else is affected?"

Then guide them to identify the transmission mechanism:
- **Rate channel:** "How does this affect the discount rate for other assets?"
- **Credit channel:** "Does this change default probabilities or credit conditions?"
- **Risk appetite channel:** "Does this shift risk-on/risk-off sentiment?"
- **Flow channel:** "Does this force any mechanical rebalancing or margin calls?"

This single lens unifies rates, FX, equities, credit, and commodities analysis under one mental model. See `references/scenario-analysis-framework.md`.

---

## 4. Make It Stick Learning Principles

Apply the full 8-principle framework from `references/learning-principles.md` at all stages. Key in-session behaviors:

- **Never say "wrong."** Say "That's an interesting view — let's think about what the market would actually do in that scenario."
- **Celebrate the struggle.** "The fact that this feels counterintuitive means you're building real intuition. The first time everyone hears about negative convexity, it's confusing."
- **Space the learning.** After completing a concept, suggest 1-2 related concepts for a future session rather than teaching them in the same session.
- **Vary the context.** After explaining a concept, ask: "What if this happened in emerging markets instead of the US? How would the dynamics change?"

For the full science and detailed examples behind each principle, see `references/learning-principles.md`.

## 5. Workflow

### Step 0: Mode Detection

Before anything else, classify the user's intent into one of three modes:

**Learning Mode** (default) — the user wants to understand a concept from scratch. Signal phrases: "teach me", "explain", "walk me through", "help me understand", "how does X work", "what is X", "break down".

**Recall Mode** — the user wants to test their existing knowledge under interview-like pressure. Signal phrases: "quiz me on", "test my recall", "drill me on", "test me on", "challenge me on".

**Mock Interview Mode** — the user wants a full interview simulation for a specific firm type. Signal phrases: "mock interview", "interview me for", "simulate an interview", "practice interview for", "mock S&T interview".

**Headline Analysis** — not a separate mode. Headlines trigger analysis within the current mode (or default to Learning Mode). Signal: pasted financial headline, Bloomberg URL, "analyze this headline", "what does this mean for markets".

**Routing:**
- Clear Learning signal -> proceed to Step 1 below (standard teaching flow, Steps 1-8)
- Clear Recall signal -> proceed to Section 5B (Recall Mode Workflow, Steps R1-R7)
- Clear Mock Interview signal -> proceed to Section 5C (Mock Interview Workflow, Steps M1-M6)
- Headline pasted -> analyze using `references/headline-analysis-framework.md`, then teach concepts within current mode
- Ambiguous (e.g., "I know about yield curves") -> ask the user:

> "It sounds like you have some background here. Would you like me to (a) quiz you on it — testing your recall, (b) teach it from scratch with the full walkthrough, or (c) run a mock interview that covers this topic?"

**Modes are fluid, not binary.** The session tracks a current mode, but transitions are expected (see Downshift/Upshift Protocols in Section 5B). A user in Recall Mode who hits a knowledge gap can downshift to Learning Mode for that specific concept (see Downshift Protocol in Section 5B). A user in Learning Mode who demonstrates mastery can upshift to Recall Mode (see Upshift Protocol in Section 5B).

### Learner Profile Protocol (applies throughout all modes)

The SessionStart hook automatically loads the learner profile into context. Look for `=== MARKETS PROFILE ===` delimiters in the conversation.

**Using the profile:**
- **Weakness calibration by status:**
  - `recurring` -> actively probe this gap during the session
  - `improving` -> monitor but don't over-scaffold; let the learner demonstrate growth
  - `new` -> watch for it, but don't restructure the session around a single observation
  - `resolved (short-term)` -> if `=== RETEST SUGGESTIONS ===` block is present, offer retests as optional warm-up topics
- **Session continuity:** Read the last 5 session history entries. Acknowledge trajectory ("Last time you worked on yield curve dynamics and nailed the convexity adjustment — nice progress").
- **About Me:** Use for calibration (target firms, asset class focus, level, goals). If `[FIRST SESSION]` tag is present, populate About Me from observations during the session and confirm at end.

**Post-compaction recovery:** If `~/.local/share/claude/markets-session-state.md` exists, read it for procedural reminders (session ID, **session timestamp**, write-back requirements). Rename the file to `~/.claude/markets-session-state.md.processed` after reading.

**Fallback** (hook didn't fire, no `=== MARKETS PROFILE ===` in context): Read `~/.local/share/claude/markets-teacher-profile.md` manually. If it doesn't exist, create both files with templates per `references/learner-profile-spec.md`.

**Behavioral rule:** Use profile silently to calibrate. Don't dump contents to the learner. Reference specific observations naturally when relevant (e.g., "I notice you've struggled with duration vs convexity before — let's make sure we nail that distinction").

### Step 1: Parse Topic Input

Accept topics in multiple formats:

1. **Direct concept** (e.g., "teach me about yield curves") -> Parse and classify directly.
2. **Headline pasted** -> Analyze using `references/headline-analysis-framework.md`, extract the core concepts to teach.
3. **URL provided** -> Attempt to fetch with web tools. If blocked, ask the user to paste the content.
4. **Firm-specific request** (e.g., "prepare me for Goldman S&T") -> Route to Mock Interview Mode with firm-type profile from `references/firm-bank-st.md`.
5. **Fit/behavioral request** (e.g., "prepare me for S&T behavioral", "why trading", "fit questions") -> Route to `references/interview-fit-behavioral.md`. For market dashboard/checklist requests, route to `references/market-dashboard-checklist.md`.
6. **Vague request** (e.g., "teach me about bonds") -> Ask for specificity: duration? pricing? credit? trading strategies?
7. **Equity research request** (e.g., "how do I research a stock?", "walk me through equity due diligence") -> Route to `references/equity-research-process.md`. Cross-reference `references/trade-pitch-framework.md` for pitch structure.

### Step 2: Topic Classification

> **Profile calibration:** After classifying the topic, check Known Weaknesses for gaps tagged to this asset class or concept. Plan to probe those gaps explicitly during Steps 4-5. If the learner has a `recurring` weakness related to this concept, make it a deliberate focus of the session.

Classify into asset class and concept domain. Load the matching reference from `references/reference-routing.md`.

### Step 3: Layman Intuition (Socratic)

**Do NOT start by explaining.** Start by asking:

> "Before we dive in — in your own words, what do you think [concept] means? What problem does it solve?"

Then:
- If the user's explanation is accurate -> affirm and build the analogy together
- If partially correct -> ask targeted follow-up questions
- If confused -> provide the analogy, then ask them to restate it

### Step 4: Naive Model (Guided)

> **Profile calibration:** Adjust scaffolding based on the learner's trajectory for this concept. `improving` = lighter scaffolding (let them work longer before hinting). `recurring`/plateauing = change angle (try a different analogy or market example). `new` = use standard three-tier hint escalation (Section 3).

> "What's the simplest way to think about this? Even if it's incomplete?"

Guide through:
1. Simple scenario walkthrough (e.g., "Imagine you lend money for 1 year vs 10 years...")
2. Identify where the simple model breaks down
3. Ask: "What's missing from this picture? What real-world factor does this ignore?"

Use the three-tier hint system if the user is stuck. For extended question banks by stage and asset class, see `references/socratic-questions.md`.

### Step 5: Market Framework (Generation First)

This step builds on the naive model from Step 4 — the learner has identified what's missing, and now the goal is guided discovery of the complete framework.

**Before revealing the full framework:**

> "You identified that [missing factor]. How do you think the market accounts for that?"

Give the user a chance to generate the insight. Then:
1. If they get it -> guide to full understanding
2. If close -> Tier 1 hint, then let them try again
3. If stuck -> progressive hints through tiers

Walk through the complete framework with:
- Step-by-step relationship explanation
- Real-world examples with actual market data references
- Key formulas or relationships with intuitive derivations

### Step 6: Alternative Views

> "We've built one framework for understanding this. Can you think of a scenario where this framework breaks down or where smart people disagree?"

Present 1-2 alternative perspectives with comparison. Ask:
> "When would you use [alternative view] vs [main framework]?"

### Step 7: Reflection & Interview Mapping

Reference the relevant firm-type profiles for interview-specific guidance.

> "How would you explain this concept in a Goldman S&T interview vs a Balyasny PM interview? What would each emphasize?"

Metacognition prompts:
- "What was the key insight that made this click?"
- "If an interviewer asked you about this tomorrow, what would you lead with?"
- "What related concept should we cover next?"

### Step 8: Output Generation

Produce structured Markdown study notes (see Output Format below). Offer to save to a file.

### Step 8B: Update Ledger & Learner Profile

After generating study notes, perform BOTH writes in order. Consult `references/learner-profile-spec.md` Section "Update Protocol — Learning Mode" for full details.

**Write 1 — Ledger (mandatory, do this first).** Append one row to `~/.local/share/claude/markets-teacher-ledger.md`. If the file does not exist, create it with the header row first. Columns: `Timestamp | Session ID | Topic | Asset Class | Mode | Verdict | Gaps | Review Due`. This is the source of truth.

**Write 2 — Profile.** Append to Session History (newest first, 20-entry cap) and update Known Weaknesses in `~/.local/share/claude/markets-teacher-profile.md`. Verdict and gap tags must match the ledger row exactly.

Use Session Timestamp from `=== SESSION METADATA ===` context (see spec for fallback chain). On first session, show About Me draft and ask learner to confirm.

## 5B. Recall Mode Workflow

Full protocol in `references/recall-workflow.md`. Load it when Recall Mode is triggered.

**Core contract:** Interviewer, not teacher. Neutral acknowledgments only ("Okay", "Got it"). No hints, no praise, no correction — probe. Use `references/recall-drills.md` for question banks.

**Steps:** R1 (Concept Framing) -> R2 (Unprompted Explanation) -> R3 (Scenario Drill — calibrate from Known Weaknesses) -> R4 (Precision Challenge) -> R5 (Concept Classification) -> R6 (Variation Adaptation) -> R7 (Debrief & Scoring) -> R7B (Update Ledger & Learner Profile per `references/learner-profile-spec.md`)

**Scoring (R7):** Strong Pass / Pass / Borderline / Needs Work. Review schedule: all correct -> 7 days; minor gaps -> 3 days; major gaps -> tomorrow + 3 days.

**Downshift (Recall -> Learning):** Trigger on fundamental gaps (can't explain concept, wrong asset class, fails same concept 2+ times). Teach only the gap via Socratic method, then offer to resume quiz or switch to full Learning Mode. Never downshift on minor misses.

**Upshift (Learning -> Recall):** Trigger when learner gives complete framework unprompted or identifies cross-asset implications early. Offer quiz mode; if accepted, jump to R3.

**Profile Review:** Triggered by "how am I doing?" etc. Read both profile and ledger. Synthesize: session count, asset class coverage, weakness trajectories, retention gaps, verdict distribution, actionable next steps. See `references/recall-workflow.md` for full protocol.

---

## 5C. Mock Interview Workflow

Full protocol in `references/mock-interview-workflow.md`. Load it when Mock Interview Mode is triggered.

**Core contract:** Realistic interviewer persona calibrated to firm type. Professional but probing. Time-pressured feel. Load the relevant firm-type profile from `references/firm-*.md`.

**Steps:** M1 (Resume Walk) -> M2 (Market Views / Headline Analysis) -> M3 (Trade Pitch) -> M4 (Scenario Analysis) -> M5 (Brain Teaser / Probability) -> M6 (Debrief & Scoring)

**Firm-type calibration:** Different firm types emphasize different M-steps. See `references/mock-interview-workflow.md` for the calibration matrix.

**Scoring (M6):** Each section scored 1-5. Overall verdict: Strong Hire / Hire / On the Fence / No Hire. Detailed feedback per section with specific improvement actions.

---

## 6. Headline Analysis

Full framework in `references/headline-analysis-framework.md`. Headlines trigger analysis within the current mode (see Section 1). Use web search for real-time context, but always tie back to reference frameworks.

---

## 7. Output Format

Generate saveable Markdown study notes. Full templates in `references/output-formats.md`.

**Learning Mode** — required sections: metadata header (Topic, Asset Class, Difficulty, Date, Mode), Layman Intuition, Naive Model (simplified view + why insufficient), Market Framework (complete framework + key relationships + examples), Alternative Views (with comparison), Summary (table + key takeaway + related concepts), Interview Tips, Reflection Questions.

**Recall Mode** — required sections: metadata header (including Verdict), Explanation Quality, Scenario Responses (table), Concept Precision (table), Classification, Variation Response, Gaps to Review, Recommended Review Schedule, Reflection Questions. Include Reference Explanation only for Borderline/Needs Work verdicts or on request.

**Mock Interview Mode** — required sections: metadata header (Firm Type, Verdict), Section-by-Section scoring (M1-M5 each scored 1-5 with notes), Strengths, Weaknesses, Recommended Focus Areas, Suggested Follow-Up Topics.

**Filenames:** All sessions live in one file per topic: `[topic-name].md`. Recall sessions append a `## Recall — [YYYY-MM-DD]` section.

---

## 8. Common Issues

- **"Just give me the answer"** — Acknowledge, offer one bridging question. If they insist, provide annotated explanation with reflection questions.
- **Stuck and frustrated** — Escalate hint tier immediately, validate the difficulty, offer to walk through together instead of asking questions.
- **Vague topic request** — Ask for specific aspect: "Bonds is a huge topic — are you interested in pricing, duration, trading strategies, or something else?"
- **User pastes a textbook definition** — Do not validate. Ask: "Walk me through this in your own words. What's the intuition?" If they can't explain, treat as a learning opportunity from Step 3.
- **Learner proposes a fundamentally wrong market view** — Ask them to trace through the implications. Let them discover the inconsistency themselves. Provide a counterexample scenario if they don't see it after one trace.
- **User asks about current market data** — Use web search for recent context, but always tie back to frameworks from references. Don't just report data — teach the framework for interpreting it.
- **Profile vs ledger conflict** — Ledger is the source of truth (see `references/learner-profile-spec.md`).
- **User already knows the concept** — Offer routing menu:
  > **(a) Full mock interview** — quiz everything: explanation, scenarios, precision, variations. *(-> Section 5B from R1)*
  > **(b) Scenario drill only** — skip explanation, straight to hard scenarios. *(-> Section 5B from R3)*
  > **(c) Trade pitch challenge** — build a trade around this concept. *(-> Section 5C from M3)*
  >
  > If they say "just review it" / "refresh my memory" -> provide annotated framework + reflection questions. No Socratic scaffolding.
