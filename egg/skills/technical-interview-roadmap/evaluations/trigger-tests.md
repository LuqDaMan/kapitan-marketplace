## Edge Cases

| Input | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|
| "technical interview roadmap" (no JD URL or text provided) | Trigger skill, Step 1 prompts user to provide a JD URL or paste JD text |
| "coding prep for Citadel" (no leetcode-teacher profile exists) | Trigger skill, default to Intermediate calibration, note in output that profile was not found |
| "technical prep for a startup I'm interviewing at" (no specific company) | Trigger skill, ask for company name, use Startup archetype if company research is thin |
| "DSA roadmap for Goldman Sachs trading technology" | Trigger skill, map to Quant/HFT archetype, finance domain |
| "prep me for the coding rounds" (ambiguous — could be behavioral-interview-prepper) | Should trigger technical-interview-roadmap due to "coding rounds" — distinct from "behavioral" |
| "I finished my resume, what's next?" | May trigger if resume-builder output exists and context suggests technical prep; otherwise ask for clarification |
| "prep me for all interviews at Google" | Should trigger this skill for technical portion; may also suggest behavioral-interview-prepper separately |
| "Create a roadmap for both technical and behavioral prep" | Should trigger this skill for the technical portion; suggest behavioral-interview-prepper for behavioral prep |
| "DSA roadmap from this JD: [URL]" (URL fetch fails) | Step 1b fallback: ask user to paste JD text directly |
| "coding prep plan" + user pastes JD text (no company name obvious) | Step 1b: extract company name from JD text, ask user if ambiguous |
