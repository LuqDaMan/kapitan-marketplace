# Changelog

## Completed

- **TODO-1:** Direct JD URL/text input with DSA-focused extraction (Step 1b). notes.md dependency removed entirely.
- **TODO-1.5:** De-emphasized Step 6a as "Optional Bonus", dropped six-months.csv fallback, tightened failure messaging to normalize missing data.
- **TODO-2:** Added competitive firm difficulty uplift. Role level sets base difficulty; competitive archetypes (FAANG, Quant, AI Labs, Gov/Defense) add stretch problems above the base.
- **TODO-3:** Added Critical Rule 8 ("Companies test what they build") requiring backward reasoning from company engineering challenges to DSA concepts to problems.
- **TODO-4:** Eliminated jd-signals.md as separate output. Raw JD text merged into technical-roadmap.md appendix.
- **TODO-5:** Extracted output template to `references/output-template.md` to reduce SKILL.md word count. Fixed stale resume-builder reference in `jd-signal-mapping.md`. Added deduplication note to `curated-problem-bank.md`.
