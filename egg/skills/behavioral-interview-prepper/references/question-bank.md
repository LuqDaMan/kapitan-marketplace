# Question Bank

## Overview
Master list of behavioral interview questions organized by trait cluster. Use this in Step 3 to select 10-15 questions based on the JD behavioral signals extracted via `behavioral-signals.md`.

## Question Format

Each question is tagged: `[format, difficulty, common-at]`

- **Format:** behavioral / motivational / hypothetical / self-assessment
- **Difficulty:** standard (standalone question) / probing (interviewer follow-up to dig deeper)
- **Common at:** FAANG / quant / AI labs / general

## Finance-Specific Note

For trading, quant, and finance roles, also load `finance-behavioral.md` for additional questions covering market intuition, risk judgment, P&L ownership, and pressure-performance scenarios.

## Selection Guidance

Use the weighted extraction output from `behavioral-signals.md` to pick 10-15 questions:

1. **Primary clusters** (3+ JD signals): select 2-3 questions per cluster
2. **Secondary clusters** (1-2 JD signals): select 1 question per cluster
3. **Motivation & Fit**: always include at least 2
4. **Hypothetical / Situational**: include 1-2
5. **Probing questions**: do not select as standalone — these are interviewer follow-ups that the candidate should anticipate after answering the parent question

### Example Selection

Given primary clusters = {Leadership & Ownership, Collaboration} and secondary = {Resilience & Ambiguity}:

| Source | Count | Questions Selected |
|---|---|---|
| Leadership & Ownership | 3 | "took ownership beyond role", "drove result end-to-end", "set direction when unclear" |
| Collaboration | 2 | "cross-functional team", "aligned competing stakeholders" |
| Resilience & Ambiguity | 1 | "navigated ambiguity" |
| Motivation & Fit | 2 | "Why this company?", "Tell me about yourself." |
| Hypothetical | 1 | "disagreed with tech lead" |
| **Total** | **9-11** | Fill to 10-15 by adding from secondary clusters or self-assessment |
