# Resume Walkthrough

## Overview

Guide for crafting the 90-second resume narrative — the "tell me about yourself" or "walk me through your resume" opener. This is the first impression and sets the tone for the entire interview. A dialed-in walkthrough makes the interviewer predisposed to like you before the first behavioral question.

## The 3-Act Framework

Structure the walkthrough as a narrative arc with positive, deliberate transitions:

### Act 1: Where You Started (15-20 seconds)
- Anchor in your earliest relevant professional context
- One sentence on what drew you to that field
- Example: "I studied computer science at [University] because I was fascinated by how systems process information at scale."

### Act 2: Key Transitions (40-50 seconds, ~20s per transition)
- Cover 2-3 career moves, each with a **positive motivating reason**
- Every transition must sound intentional and self-initiated
- Pattern: "I wanted to [grow/deepen/expand] my [skill/exposure/impact], so I [sought/pursued/moved to]..."

### Act 3: Why You're Here Now (15-20 seconds)
- Land on the current role/interview target
- Connect your trajectory to THIS specific opportunity
- End with a hook that invites a follow-up question

**Total: 90 seconds / ~225 words**

## Transition Framing Rules

Every career move must have a positive, forward-looking reason. The interviewer should think "this person is deliberate about their career."

### Strong Transition Phrases
- "I wanted to deepen my exposure to X, so I pursued..."
- "After developing strong skills in A, I sought a role where I could apply them to B..."
- "I was drawn to [Company] because they offered the chance to work on C at scale..."
- "I realized I was most energized by D, which led me to..."

### Never Say (Anti-Patterns)
| Weak Framing | Why It Fails | Strong Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "I was bored" | Signals you get bored easily | "I'd mastered the core challenges and wanted to grow into X" |
| "Wanted to try something new" | No direction, sounds aimless | "I was drawn to Y because of my experience with Z" |
| "Left because of bad management" | Negative, blames others | "I sought a team culture that aligned with my collaborative working style" |
| "The company was struggling" | Sounds like you flee problems | "I was looking to apply my skills in a higher-growth environment" |
| "The money was better" | Signals mercenary mindset | "The role offered both a technical challenge and career growth" |
| "I got laid off" | Even if true, reframe it | "When the team was restructured, I took the opportunity to pursue X" |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Tech → Tech (Backend → ML)

> I started as a backend engineer at [Startup] building real-time data pipelines — I was drawn to the challenge of processing millions of events reliably. After two years, I realized the most impactful part of my work was the data modeling layer, which led me to pursue machine learning more formally. I moved to [Company] where I could combine my systems engineering background with ML — building production inference pipelines that serve 50M daily predictions. That intersection of systems and ML is exactly what excites me about this role: you're building the infrastructure that makes ML work at scale, and my background sits right at that intersection.

### Example 2: Tech → Finance (SWE → Quant)

> I spent four years building low-latency trading systems at [Tech Company], where I developed a deep appreciation for how milliseconds of optimization translate to real P&L impact. That experience sparked my interest in the quantitative side — not just building the systems, but understanding the strategies they execute. I completed a master's in financial engineering to formalize that interest, focusing on statistical arbitrage and market microstructure. Now I'm looking to bring both skill sets together: my engineering ability to build production-grade systems and my quantitative training to develop and deploy trading strategies. Your firm's focus on systematic trading with a strong technology culture is exactly that combination.

### Example 3: Career Changer (Non-Tech → Tech)

> I started my career in management consulting at [Firm], where I spent three years solving operational problems for Fortune 500 clients. I loved the analytical rigor but found myself consistently gravitating toward the technical implementation side — I kept volunteering for the data analysis workstreams and eventually taught myself Python to automate our reporting. That hands-on experience convinced me to make the switch to engineering full-time. I completed [Bootcamp/Degree] and joined [Company] as a data engineer, where my consulting background in stakeholder management and structured problem-solving turned out to be a major advantage in a cross-functional team. This role appeals to me because it combines technical depth with the kind of business impact I valued in consulting.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too long (>2 minutes):** The walkthrough is a warm-up, not your life story. If you're past 90 seconds, cut details.
2. **Too chronological:** Don't narrate every job. Pick the 2-3 transitions that build toward THIS role.
3. **No narrative arc:** Random facts about each job ≠ a story. Each transition should build on the previous one.
4. **Missing the landing:** The walkthrough must end by connecting to the role you're interviewing for. Don't trail off.
5. **Reciting the resume:** The interviewer has your resume. The walkthrough adds the WHY behind the WHAT.
6. **Negative framing:** One negative transition poisons the whole narrative. Always move toward, never away.
